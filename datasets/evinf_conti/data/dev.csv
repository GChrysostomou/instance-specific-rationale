We investigated the effect of astaxanthin ( Asx ) supplementation on salivary IgA ( sIgA ) and oxidative stress status in plasma , along with changes in biochemical parameters and total / differential white cell counts . Forty trained male soccer players were randomly assigned to Asx and placebo groups . Asx group was supplemented with 4 mg of Asx . Saliva and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 90 days of supplementation in preexercise conditions . We observed a rise of sIgA levels at rest after 90 days of Asx supplementation , which was accompanied with a decrease in prooxidant - antioxidant balance . The plasma muscle enzymes levels were reduced significantly by Asx supplementation and by regular training . The increase in neutrophil count and hs - CRP level was found only in placebo group , indicating a significant blunting of the systemic inflammatory response in the subjects taking Asx . This study indicates that Asx supplementation improves sIgA response and attenuates muscle damage , thus preventing inflammation induced by rigorous physical training . Our findings also point that Asx could show significant physiologic modulation in individuals with mucosal immunity impairment or under conditions of increased oxidative stress and inflammation .",attention,placebo (P group) || baseline || high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),"[(167, 186)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : SMS via mobile phone has emerged as a potential tool for improving ART adherence . However , most studies used SMS only as a medication reminder , with few studies exploring the effect of comprehensive , interactive SMS . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : In a randomized controlled trial , 100 HIV - positive patients on ART for <3 months were randomized into control or intervention arm . Participants in the control group received routine standard instruction for ART medication in the HIV clinics , while the intervention group received 6 months of an SMS intervention in addition to the standard care . A total of 124 text messages within 6 modules were edited , preinstalled , and sent to participants according to personalized schedules . Knowledge ( of HIV and HIV medications ) , self - reported antiretroviral adherence ( Visual Analog Scale [ VAS ] and Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS [ CPCRA ] Antiretroviral Medication Self - Report ) , and CD4 count were assessed at baseline and immediate post - intervention . Intervention participants were interviewed after completion of the study about their satisfaction with and acceptability of the SMS intervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline assessments were comparable between arms . Repeated - measures analysis showed that both HIV - related and ART medication knowledge of the intervention group showed better improvement over time than those of the control group after the intervention ( P<0.0001 ) . For the adherence measures , compared with the control group , participants in the intervention group had significantly higher VAS mean score ( Z=2.735 , P=0.006 ) and lower suboptimal adherence rate ( Z=2.208 , P=0.027 ) at the end of the study . The intervention had no effect on CD4 cell count . Almost all ( 96 % ) intervention participants reported satisfaction or high satisfaction with the SMS intervention , with 74 % desiring to continue to receive the SMS intervention . The preferred frequency of messages was 1–2 messages per week . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : An interactive SMS intervention with comprehensive content shows promising efficacy in promoting medication adherence in ART - naïve individuals . Future work might further refine its ability to optimally tailor the intervention for individual preferences .",attention,interactive short message service (SMS) || standard care || HIV-related and ART medication knowledge,"[(275, 311)]",1,dev,attention
227,5571924_1,5571924,"TITLE : A prediction model for advanced colorectal neoplasia in an asymptomatic screening population ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : An electronic medical record ( EMR ) database of a large unselected population who received screening colonoscopies may minimize sampling error and represent real - world estimates of risk for screening target lesions of advanced colorectal neoplasia ( CRN ) . Our aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for assessing the probability of advanced CRN using a clinical data warehouse . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 49,450 screenees underwent their first colonoscopy as part of a health check - up from 2002 to 2012 at Samsung Medical Center , and the dataset was constructed by means of natural language processing from the computerized EMR system . The screenees were randomized into training and validation sets . The prediction model was developed using logistic regression . The model performance was validated and compared with existing models using area under receiver operating curve ( AUC ) analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the training set , age , gender , smoking duration , drinking frequency , and aspirin use were identified as independent predictors for advanced CRN ( adjusted P < .01 ) . The developed model had good discrimination ( AUC = 0.726 ) and was internally validated ( AUC = 0.713 ) . The high - risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the low - risk group ( 1.1 % vs. 4.0 % , P < .001 ) . The discrimination performance of the present model for high - risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the Asia - Pacific Colorectal Screening score ( AUC = 0.678 , P < .001 ) and Schroy 's CAN index ( AUC = 0.672 , P < .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The present 5-item risk model can be calculated readily using a simple questionnaire and can identify the low- and high - risk groups of advanced CRN at the first screening colonoscopy . This model may increase colorectal cancer risk awareness and assist healthcare providers in encouraging the high - risk group to undergo a colonoscopy .",attention,high-risk group || low-risk group || advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRN),"[(253, 304)]",1,dev,attention
290,3897026_0,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable , particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour . Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak . The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption , delivered in a workplace as part of a health check . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : This two - group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK - based private sector organisation ( approx . 100,000 employees ) . 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period . Of these , 1,330 ( 39 % ) scored five or more on the AUDIT - C ( indicating alcohol misuse ) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake , alongside feedback on other health behaviours ( n = 659 ) , or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake ( n = 671 ) . Participants were mostly male ( 75 % ) , with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions ( 55 % ) . Median Body Mass Index was 26 , 12 % were smokers , median time undertaking moderate / vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day . Eighty percent ( n = 1,066 ) of participants completed follow - up questionnaires at three months . An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking ( primary outcome ) ( 5.6 % increase associated with the intervention ( 95 % CI −4.7 % to 16.9 % ; p = .30 ) ) , AUDIT ( measure of alcohol - related harm ) and health utility ( EQ-5D ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation . Further research is needed on how to engage a larger proportion of employees in screening .

Additionally , the in - patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared . 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD - VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine ( 910 mg / m2 at day 1–3 ) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide . Patients were stratified according to pretreatment . HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin ( 500 mg / m2 / d over 18 h ) , ifosfamide ( 4 g / m2 / d over 4 h ) and etoposide ( 500 mg / m2 / d ) all given for 3 consecutive days . All patients received prophylactic application of G - CSF ( 5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously ) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment . Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity , gastrointestinal side effects , haematopoietic recovery , as well as frequency of fever and infections . The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was 10 % from baseline in the amifostine group ( 105 to 95 ml min−1 ) and 37 % in the control patient group ( 107 to 67 ml min−1 ) ( P < 0.01 ) . Amifostine - treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion . Stomatitis grade III / IV occurred in 25 % without versus 0 % of patients with amifostine ( P = 0.01 ) . Acute nausea / vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists / dexamethasone / trifluorpromazine . However , delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients . Engraftment of neutrophil ( > 500 μl−1 ) and thrombocytes ( > 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12 , respectively , both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm . In addition , a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm . The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30 % savings in costs for supportive care ( Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient ) . Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine , calculation of in - patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm . This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD - VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine . Additionally , a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine - treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned .

241,3564932_2,3564932,"TITLE : Outpatient Foley catheter versus inpatient prostaglandin E2 gel for induction of labour : a randomised trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Induction of labour ( IOL ) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions , with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery . Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) .

Question asking is one way in which patients can be active . We investigated 2 means of promoting cancer patient question asking . One was the provision of a question prompt sheet to patients prior to their initial consultation with their oncologist . The second was the active endorsement and systematic review of the question prompt sheet by their oncologist . 318 patients with heterogeneous cancers , seeing one of 5 medical and 4 radiation oncologists for the first time , were randomised to either receive or not receive a question prompt sheet . Doctors were randomised to either proactively address or passively respond to the question prompt sheet in the subsequent consultation . Anxiety was assessed prior to the consultation . Consultations were audiotaped and content analysed . Anxiety was assessed again immediately following the consultation . Within the next 10 days patients completed questionnaires assessing information needs , anxiety and satisfaction and were given a structured telephone interview assessing information recall . Patients provided with a question prompt sheet asked more questions about prognosis compared with controls and oncologists gave significantly more prognostic information to these patients . Provision of the question prompt sheet prolonged consultations and increased patient anxiety ; however , when oncologists specifically addressed the prompt sheet , anxiety levels were significantly reduced , consultation duration was decreased and recall was significantly improved . A patient question prompt sheet , used proactively by the doctor , is a powerful addition to the oncology consultation . © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign",scaled attention,Patients who received a question prompt sheet || Patients who didn't receive a question prompt sheet || Anxiety,"[(221, 260)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 40 participants with type 1 diabetes , of whom 24 were adults [ mean ± standard deviation ( s.d . ) age 43 ± 12 years and glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 8.0 ± 0.9 % ] and 16 were adolescents ( mean ± s.d . age 15.6 ± 3.6 years and HbA1c 8.1 ± 0.8 % ) , underwent two periods of sensor‐augmented pump therapy in the home setting , in combination with or without an overnight closed‐loop insulin delivery system that uses a model predictive control algorithm to direct insulin delivery . The order of the two interventions was random ; each period lasted 4 weeks in adults and 3 weeks in adolescents . The primary outcome was time during which sensor glucose readings were in the target range of 3.9–8.0 mmol / l . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range ( 3.9–8.0 mmol / l ) overnight ( between 24:00 and 08:00 hours ) was 18.5 % greater during closed‐loop insulin delivery than during sensor‐augmented therapy ( p < 0.001 ) . Closed‐loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol / l ( p < 0.001 ) , with no difference in glycaemic variability , as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose . Time spent above the target range was reduced ( p = 0.001 ) , as was time spent in hypoglycaemia ( < 3.9 mmol / l ; p = 0.014 ) during closed‐loop therapy . Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed‐loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery ( p < 0.001 ) without changes to the total daily delivery ( p = 0.84 ) .

648,4684352_2,4684352,"TITLE : Dietary Mannoheptulose Does Not Significantly Alter Daily Energy Expenditure in Adult Labrador Retrievers ABSTRACT : Mannoheptulose ( MH ) , a sugar found in avocados that inhibits glycolysis in vitro , has been preliminarily investigated as a novel food ingredient for dogs . This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH , delivered as an extract of un - ripened avocado , on energy expenditure ( EE ) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs ( total of 12 dogs , 26.99 ± 0.634 kg , 4.9 ± 0.2 y ) . The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",scaled attention,Mannoheptulose || Control || Resting energy expenditure,"[(243, 258)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index ( GI ) and anti - hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats . Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) . No significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) in insulin , cholesterol measurements ( total cholesterol , LDL - C , HDL - C , triglycerides and cholesterol ratios ) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed . All other measurements ( AST , ALT , ALP , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c ( p > 0.05 ) of type 2 diabetic patients . The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested . Therefore , the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients .",attention,Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) || Any other food || Insulin and cholesterol levels,"[(419, 459)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : In an open - label randomized trial , HIV - infected patients were randomized to switch from zidovudine / lamivudine ( AZT/3TC ) to abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) or tenofovir / emtricitabine ( TDF / FTC ) . We measured bone mass density ( BMD ) and bone turnover biomarkers ( osteocalcin , osteocalcin , procollagen type 1 N - terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) , alkaline phosphatase , type I collagen cross - linked C - telopeptide ( CTx ) , and osteoprotegerin ) . We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance , plasma cystatin C , and urinary levels of creatinine , albumin , cystatin C , and neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of 40 included patients , 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up . BMD was measured in 33 , 26 , and 27 patients at baseline , week 24 , and week 48 , respectively . In TDF / FTC - treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 ( −1.8 % and −2.5 % ) and week 48 ( −2.1 % and −2.1 % ) , whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm . The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms . All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF / FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm , but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD . Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF - treated patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Switching to TDF / FTC - based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC - based treatment . No major difference in renal function was observed .

This 12-week , double - blind study compared the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 ( mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post - dose ) at Week 12 ( primary endpoint ) and after Day 1 , and the percentage of COPD days with poor control ( i.e. , worsening symptoms ) . Safety was assessed by adverse events ( AEs ) , mean serum potassium and blood glucose , QTc ( Fridericia ) , and vital signs . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients were randomised ( n = 416 , mean age 63 years ) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d . ( n = 211 ) or placebo ( n = 205 ) via a single - dose dry - powder inhaler ; 87.5 % completed the study . Trough FEV1 ( LSM ± SEM ) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo , a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL ( p < 0.001 ) . Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) . Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo , both on Day 1 and at Week 12 , with indacaterol - placebo differences ( LSM ± SEM ) of 190 ± 28 ( p < 0.001 ) and 160 ± 28 mL ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 ( between 5 min and 4 h , 5 min and 1 h , and 1 and 4 h post - dose ) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) , with LSM ( ± SEM ) differences of 170 ± 24 , 180 ± 24 , and 170 ± 24 mL , respectively . Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5 % ( p < 0.001 ) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication ( p < 0.001 ) . The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups ( indacaterol 49.3 % , placebo 46.8 % ) , with the most common AEs being COPD worsening ( indacaterol 8.5 % , placebo 12.2 % ) and cough ( indacaterol 6.2 % , placebo 7.3 % ) . One patient died in the placebo group . Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups , and no patient had QTc > 500 ms .

To evaluate the efficacy of epoetin - α prior to revision total knee arthroplasty , we hypothesized that epoetin - α will reduce blood transfusion . Methods . Eighty - one patients were compared in this retrospective review ; twenty - eight patients received our dosing regimen . All patients were mildly anemic . Epoetin - α to control ( 1 : 2 ) patient matching occurred so that one of two attending surgeons , gender , BMI , complexity of surgery , ASA score , and age were similar between groups . The clinical triggers for blood transfusion during or after the procedure were determined based on peri- and postoperative hemoglobin levels , ASA score , and/or clinical symptoms consistent with anemia . Blood salvage was not used . Results . Blood transfusion and length of stay were lower in the study group . None of the patients who received epoetin - α underwent transfusion . Hemoglobin increased from 11.97 to 13.8 , preoperatively . Hemoglobin at day of surgery and time of discharge were higher . Gender , BMI , ASA score , total and hidden blood losses , calculated blood loss , preop PLT , PT , PTT , and INR were similar between groups . One Epogen patient had an uncomplicated DVT ( 3.6 % ) . Conclusions . Epoetin - α may have a role in the mildly anemic revision knee patient . It may also decrease patient length of stay allowing for earlier readiness to resume normal activities and/or meet short - term milestones . A randomized study to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of such a treatment methodology in the mildly anemic revision patient may be warranted .",scaled attention,epoetin-α || control || hidden blood loss,"[(188, 219)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : SMS via mobile phone has emerged as a potential tool for improving ART adherence . However , most studies used SMS only as a medication reminder , with few studies exploring the effect of comprehensive , interactive SMS . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : In a randomized controlled trial , 100 HIV - positive patients on ART for <3 months were randomized into control or intervention arm . Participants in the control group received routine standard instruction for ART medication in the HIV clinics , while the intervention group received 6 months of an SMS intervention in addition to the standard care . A total of 124 text messages within 6 modules were edited , preinstalled , and sent to participants according to personalized schedules . Knowledge ( of HIV and HIV medications ) , self - reported antiretroviral adherence ( Visual Analog Scale [ VAS ] and Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS [ CPCRA ] Antiretroviral Medication Self - Report ) , and CD4 count were assessed at baseline and immediate post - intervention . Intervention participants were interviewed after completion of the study about their satisfaction with and acceptability of the SMS intervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline assessments were comparable between arms . Repeated - measures analysis showed that both HIV - related and ART medication knowledge of the intervention group showed better improvement over time than those of the control group after the intervention ( P<0.0001 ) . For the adherence measures , compared with the control group , participants in the intervention group had significantly higher VAS mean score ( Z=2.735 , P=0.006 ) and lower suboptimal adherence rate ( Z=2.208 , P=0.027 ) at the end of the study . The intervention had no effect on CD4 cell count . Almost all ( 96 % ) intervention participants reported satisfaction or high satisfaction with the SMS intervention , with 74 % desiring to continue to receive the SMS intervention . The preferred frequency of messages was 1–2 messages per week .

Preliminary trial . Standardbreds underwent four arthrocentesis procedures within 48 h and exhibited elevated CS and no changes in PGE2 . Exercise trial . this randomized crossover design used twelve Standardbred mares which received either treatment ( 3000 IU d−1 oral SOD powder ) or placebo ( cellulose powder ) for 6 wks which culminated with them running a repeated sprint exercise test ( RSET ) . Samples were collected before ( PRE ) , during ( PEAK ) , and following exercise ( POST ) . Exercise resulted in increased ( P < 0.05 ) antioxidant defenses including erythrocyte SOD , total glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , gene transcripts for interferon - gamma , interleukin-10 , and interleukin-1β in blood , and decreased plasma nitric oxide . Exercise increased ( P < 0.05 ) SF CS and adjusted - PGE2 , and higher ( P < 0.05 ) CS and PGE2 were found in hock versus carpus joints . No treatment effects were detected . Results suggest normal adaptive responses likely due to exercise - induced tissue microdamage and oxidative stress .

347,4814821_3,4814821,"TITLE : Effectiveness of Telemonitoring in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Taiwan - A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is the leading cause of death worldwide , and poses a substantial economic and social burden . Telemonitoring has been proposed as a solution to this growing problem , but its impact on patient outcome is equivocal . This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate effectiveness of telemonitoring in improving COPD patient outcome . In total , 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring ( n = 53 ) or usual care ( n = 53 ) group . During the two months following discharge , telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary . The primary outcome measure was time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge . During the follow - up period , time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group ( p = 0.026 ) . Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all - cause re - admissions ( 0.23 vs. 0.68 / patient ; p = 0.002 ) and emergency room visits ( 0.36 vs. 0.91 / patient ; p = 0.006 ) . In conclusion , telemonitoring intervention was associated with improved outcomes among COPD patients admitted for exacerbation in a country characterized by a small territory and high accessibility to medical services . The findings are encouraging and add further support to implementation of telemonitoring as part of COPD care .",scaled attention,telemonitoring group || usual group || episodes of COPD-related re-admissions or ER visits per capita,"[(184, 226)]",3,dev,scaled attention

292,3897026_2,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

We investigated the effect of astaxanthin ( Asx ) supplementation on salivary IgA ( sIgA ) and oxidative stress status in plasma , along with changes in biochemical parameters and total / differential white cell counts . Forty trained male soccer players were randomly assigned to Asx and placebo groups . Asx group was supplemented with 4 mg of Asx . Saliva and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 90 days of supplementation in preexercise conditions . We observed a rise of sIgA levels at rest after 90 days of Asx supplementation , which was accompanied with a decrease in prooxidant - antioxidant balance . The plasma muscle enzymes levels were reduced significantly by Asx supplementation and by regular training . The increase in neutrophil count and hs - CRP level was found only in placebo group , indicating a significant blunting of the systemic inflammatory response in the subjects taking Asx . This study indicates that Asx supplementation improves sIgA response and attenuates muscle damage , thus preventing inflammation induced by rigorous physical training . Our findings also point that Asx could show significant physiologic modulation in individuals with mucosal immunity impairment or under conditions of increased oxidative stress and inflammation .",attention,4 mg of astaxanthin (Asx) || baseline || neutrophil count,"[(168, 185)]",1,dev,attention

488,2717426_3,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Acute , exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill .

A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy ; however , a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : Eighty – six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012 . The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively , while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The groups were equal with respect to age , gender , indication , surgeon , and type of diversion . Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay ( LOS ) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan ( 10.5 vs. 8.6 days , p = 0.005 , 95 % CI 0.6–3.3 ) .

When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters , a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction ( placebo : −13.3 % ; 1200 mg : −34.5 % , P = 0.02 ; 2400 mg : −52.7 % , P = 0.006 ) in the North American study site cluster . A concentration – response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg . Adverse event types reflected the drug 's established profile . Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate - release OXC . Once - daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Adjunctive once - daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial - onset seizures . Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate - release OXC .",scaled attention,Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg || Control || Overall seizure median percent improvement,"[(303, 366)]",3,dev,scaled attention
622,3620516_1,3620516,"TITLE : Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) of the visual cortex : a proof - of - concept study based on interictal electrophysiological abnormalities in migraine ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Preventive pharmacotherapy for migraine is not satisfactory because of the low efficacy / tolerability ratio of many available drugs . Novel and more efficient preventive strategies are therefore warranted . Abnormal excitability of cortical areas appears to play a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) is a non - invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex , and is being tested in various medical indications . The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting , possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen . We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex , especially the visual cortex , is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level . If one accepts this concept , anodal tDCS over the visual cortex may have therapeutic potentials in migraine prevention , as it is able to increase neuronal firing . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To study the effects of anodal tDCS on visual cortex activity in healthy volunteers ( HV ) and episodic migraine without aura patients ( MoA ) , and its potentials for migraine prevention . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We recorded pattern - reversal visual evoked potentials ( VEP ) before and after a 15-min session of anodal tDCS over the visual cortex in 11 HV and 13 MoA interictally . Then 10 MoA patients reporting at least 4 attacks / month subsequently participated in a therapeutic study , and received 2 similar sessions of tDCS per week for 8 weeks as migraine preventive therapy . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In HV as well as in MoA , anodal tDCS transiently increased habituation of the VEP N1P1 component . VEP amplitudes were not modified by tDCS . Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA : migraine attack frequency , migraine days , attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre - treatment baseline ( all p < 0.05 ) , and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Anodal tDCS over the visual cortex is thus able to increase habituation to repetitive visual stimuli in healthy volunteers and in episodic migraineurs , who on average lack habituation interictally . Moreover , 2 weekly sessions of anodal tDCS had a significant preventive anti- migraine effect , proofing the concept that the low preactivation level of the visual cortex in migraine patients can be corrected by an activating neurostimulation . The therapeutic results indicate that a larger sham - controlled trial using the same tDCS protocol is worthwhile .",attention,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) || baseline || migraine attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration","[(344, 389)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : We conducted a prospective pilot study of 21 consecutive favorable prognosis patients . In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm ( thin ) or 17 G/ 35 mm ( standard ) needle , the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles ( 60.6 % ) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles ( 57.7 % ) with the thinner needle ( p = 0.23 ) .

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different pre - treatments ( ethanol , ethylene de amine tetra acetic acid [ EDTA ] and EDTA + ethanol ) on the bond strength of adhesively lutted tooth colored fiber post . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : Forty - eight human anterior teeth ( incisor and canine ) were selected in this experimental study . The species were endodontically treated , and the post - space was prepared . The species were randomly divided into four groups of 12 teeth in each and were treated as follows : ( i ) 0.1 M EDTA , ( ii ) 99.6 % ethanol , ( iii ) 0.1 M EDTA followed by 99.6 % ethanol and ( iv ) without any treatment ( control ) . A push - out test was carried out after 24 h. Each tooth was cut into three 1 mm - thick sections . Fracture type was assessed using stereomicroscope . The data were analyzed by one way - ANOVA followed by Scheffe post - hoc test at P = 0.05 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Almost , in EDTA and ( EDTA + ethanol ) every sample failed at the interface between post and lutting cement .

A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) .

Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable , particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour . Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak . The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption , delivered in a workplace as part of a health check . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : This two - group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK - based private sector organisation ( approx . 100,000 employees ) . 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period . Of these , 1,330 ( 39 % ) scored five or more on the AUDIT - C ( indicating alcohol misuse ) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake , alongside feedback on other health behaviours ( n = 659 ) , or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake ( n = 671 ) . Participants were mostly male ( 75 % ) , with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions ( 55 % ) . Median Body Mass Index was 26 , 12 % were smokers , median time undertaking moderate / vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day . Eighty percent ( n = 1,066 ) of participants completed follow - up questionnaires at three months .

Volatile anesthetics induce cardioprotection in humans undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery . We hypothesized that helium induces pre- and postconditioning in CABG - patients , affecting signaling molecules protein kinase C - epsilon ( PKC - ε ) , p38 mitogen activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK ) , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK-1/2 ) and heat shock protein 27 ( HSP-27 ) within cardiac tissue , and reducing postoperative troponin levels . ABSTRACT.METHODS : After ethical approval and informed consent , 125 elective patients undergoing CABG surgery were randomised into this prospective , placebo controlled , investigator blinded , parallel arm single - centre study . Helium preconditioning ( 3 × 5 min of 70 % helium and 30 % oxygen ) was applied before aortic cross clamping ; postconditioning ( 15 min of helium ) was applied before release of the aortic cross clamp . Signaling molecules were measured in right atrial appendix specimens . Troponin - T was measured at 4 , 12 , 24 and 48 h postoperatively . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline characteristics of all groups were similar . Helium preconditioning did not significantly alter the primary outcome ( molecular levels of kinases PKC - ε and HSP-27 , ratio of activated p38 MAPK or ERK 1⁄2 ) . Postoperative troponin T was 11 arbitrary units [ 5 , 31 ; area - under - the - curve ( interquartile range ) ] for controls , and no statistically significant changes were observed after helium preconditioning [ He - pre : 11 ( 6 , 18 ) ] , helium postconditioning [ He - post : 11 ( 8 , 15 ) ] , helium pre- and postconditioning [ He - PP : 14 ( 6 , 20 ) ] and after sevoflurane preconditioning [ APC : 12 ( 8 , 24 ) , p = 0.13 ] .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) . There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion / extension ( p = 0.269 ) , varus / valgus ( p = 0.653 ) or rotational alignment ( p = 0.485 ) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment ( p = 0.778 ) or posterior slope ( p = 0.164 ) of the tibial component .

A total of 120 consecutive patients were allocated alternately to the two study groups : perioperative immunomodulation with IL-2 ( IL-2 group ; n=60 ) and perioperative immunomonitoring without immunomodulation ( control group ; n=60 ) . Patients from the IL-2 group received four doses of 10 × 106 IU m−2 twice daily subcutaneously a week before operation followed by a daily maintenance dose of 3 × 106 IU m−2 subcutaneously until a day before the operation . Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity ( leucocytes , T - cell markers CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 , B - cell marker CD19 , monocyte marker CD14 , natural killer ( NK ) cell markers CD16 , CD56 , and CD57 , activation markers CD6 , CD25 , CD28 , and CD69 , progenitor cell marker CD34 , as well as IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , soluble IL-2 receptor , IL-1 receptor antagonist , transforming growth factor - β1 , and vascular endothelial growth factor ) were measured in peripheral venous blood at various intervals . Interleukin-2-related toxicity was WHO grade 1 ( 24 % ) , 2 ( 67 % ) , and 3 ( 9 % ) . In the postoperative period , T - cell markers , activation markers , and NK cell markers decreased , and IL-6 and IL-10 increased . However , all these alterations were significantly less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2 . Median follow - up was 40 months . Tumour - specific survival in the IL-2 group and the control group was 98 vs 81 % after 1 year and 86 vs 73 % after 5 years ( P=0.04 ) . A similar effect was found for progression - free survival . We conclude that IL-2 can be safely administered in the perioperative period and modulates immunological parameters .

173,5584005_0,5584005,"TITLE : Evaluation of a guided continuous quality improvement program in community pharmacies ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The importance of creating and sustaining a strong culture of patient safety has been recognized as a critical component of safe medication use . This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Guided CQI program implementation increased the self - reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff .

421,4033571_2,4033571,"TITLE : Efficacy and safety of extended - release oxcarbazepine ( Oxtellar XR ™ ) as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory partial - onset seizures : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy , tolerability , and safety of once - daily 1200 mg and 2400 mg SPN-804 ( Oxtellar XRTM , Supernus Pharmaceuticals ) , an extended - release tablet formulation of oxcarbazepine ( OXC ) , added to 1 - 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) in adults with refractory partial - onset seizures , with or without secondary generalization . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The Prospective , Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory ( PROSPER ) study was a multinational , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group Phase 3 study . The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly ( 28-day ) seizure frequency for the 16-week double - blind treatment period in the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population with analyzable seizure data . Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50 % seizure reduction , proportion of patients seizure free , and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Median percent reduction was -28.7 % for placebo , −38.2 % ( P = 0.08 vs placebo ) for once - daily SPN-804 1200 mg , and −42.9 % ( P = 0.003 ) for SPN-804 2400 mg . Responder rates were 28.1 % , 36.1 % ( P = 0.08 ) , and 40.7 % ( P = 0.02 ) ; 16-week seizure - free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3 % , 4.9 % ( P = 0.59 ) , and 11.4 % ( P = 0.008 ) , respectively . When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters , a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction ( placebo : −13.3 % ; 1200 mg : −34.5 % , P = 0.02 ; 2400 mg : −52.7 % , P = 0.006 ) in the North American study site cluster . A concentration – response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg . Adverse event types reflected the drug 's established profile . Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate - release OXC . Once - daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Adjunctive once - daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial - onset seizures . Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate - release OXC .",scaled attention,Extended-release oxcarbazepine 1200 mg || Control || Overall seizure median percent reduction,"[(208, 246)]",3,dev,scaled attention

This study was planned with an aim to study and compare the conventional clinical end point or BIS on the requirement of dosage of propofol , hemodynamic effects , and BIS alterations following propofol induction . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : 70 patients , ASA I and II , 20 - 60 years undergoing elective surgical procedure under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were selected and divided into two groups . Group A received ( inj . ) fentanyl ( 2 μg / kg ) , followed 3 min later by inj . propofol at the rate of 30 mg / kg / hr infusion till the loss of response to verbal command while group B received inj . fentanyl ( 2 μg / kg ) , followed 3 min later by inj . propofol at the rate of 30 mg / kg / hr infusion . The end point of hypnosis was when the BIS value was sustained for 1 min at 48±2 . The patients were intubated . Total induction dose of propofol was noted in each group . The value of BIS and hemodynamic parameters ( heart rate , systolic / diastolic blood pressure ) were noted at the time of loss of consciousness , at the time of intubation , and 1 min after intubation , thereafter every minute for first 10 min and thereafter every 10 min till end of surgery . Any involuntary muscle activity such as jerky movements , dystonic posturing , and opisthotonos were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The mean dose of propofol used in groups A and B were 1.85±0.48 mg / kg and 1.79±0.41 mg / kg , respectively . The dosage used in group B were less but not clinically significant ( P=0.575 ) . On comparing the dosage of propofol in males among the groups there was a significantly lower dosage of propofol required in group B ( 2.06±0.45 mg / kg and 1.83±0.32 mg / kg , respectively , P=0.016 ) . This decrease however was not seen in female patients dosage being 1.65±0.44 mg / kg and 1.75±0.49 mg / kg , respectively ( P=0.372 ) . The hemodynamic variables including heart rate , systolic / diastolic blood pressure and BIS were comparable within the group at induction , post - induction , and intubation . However , there was a significant increase in all the parameters at postintubation readings ( P<0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : No significant difference in the induction dose of propofol was observed when assessed clinically ( loss of verbal response ) or by BIS monitoring . Traditional teaching to titrate the dose of propofol and depth of anesthesia during intubation by loss of verbal response is as good as BIS value monitoring .",scaled attention,propofol induction guided by BIS || propofol induction guided by clinical signs || dosage of propofol required by females,"[(303, 408)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index ( GI ) and anti - hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats . Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) . No significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) in insulin , cholesterol measurements ( total cholesterol , LDL - C , HDL - C , triglycerides and cholesterol ratios ) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed . All other measurements ( AST , ALT , ALP , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c ( p > 0.05 ) of type 2 diabetic patients . The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested . Therefore , the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients .",attention,Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) || Any other food || Fasting blood glucose,"[(374, 419)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The study consisted of two groups . Group 1 ( experimental group ) consisted of 20 ( 40 ears ) individuals exposed to occupational noise with hearing thresholds within 25 dB HL . They were further divided into three subgroups based on duration of noise exposure ( 0–5 years of exposure - T1 , 5–10 years of exposure - T2 , and > 10 years of exposure - T3 ) . Group 2 ( control group ) consisted of 20 individuals ( 40 ears ) . Absolute latency and amplitude of waves I , III , and V were compared between the two groups for both click and CE - chirp stimuli . T1 , T2 , and T3 groups were compared for the same parameters to see the effect of noise exposure duration on CE - chirp and click ABR . ABSTRACT.RESULT : : In Click ABR , while both the parameters for wave III were significantly poorer for the experimental group , wave V showed a significant decline in terms of amplitude only . There was no significant difference obtained for any of the parameters for wave I. In CE - Chirp ABR , the latencies for all three waves were significantly prolonged in the experimental group . However , there was a significant decrease in terms of amplitude in only wave V for the same group . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : : Compared to click evoked ABR , CE - Chirp ABR was found to be more sensitive in comparison of latency parameters in individuals with occupational noise exposure . Monitoring of early pathological changes at the brainstem level can be studied effectively by using CE - Chirp stimulus in comparison to click stimulus . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : This study indicates that ABR 's obtained with CE - chirp stimuli serves as an effective tool to identify the early pathological changes due to occupational noise exposure when compared to click evoked ABR .",deeplift,CE-chirp ABR || click ABR || wave I,"[(231, 246)]",2,dev,deeplift

641,3528484_0,3528484,"TITLE : A novel model - based approach for dose determination of glycopyrronium bromide in COPD ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Glycopyrronium bromide ( NVA237 ) is an inhaled long - acting muscarinic antagonist in development for treatment of COPD . This study compared the efficacy and safety of once - daily ( OD ) and twice - daily ( BID ) glycopyrronium bromide regimens , using a novel model - based approach , in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Double - blind , randomized , dose - finding trial with an eight - treatment , two - period , balanced incomplete block design . Patients ( smoking history ≥10 pack - years , post - bronchodilator FEV1 ≥30 % and < 80 % predicted , FEV1 / FVC < 0.7 ) were randomized to one of 16 independent sequences for 28 days . Primary endpoint : mean trough FEV1 at Day 28 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 385 patients ( mean age 61.2 years ; mean post - bronchodilator FEV1 53 % predicted ) were randomized ; 88.6 % completed . All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose - dependent bronchodilation ; at Day 28 , increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens , ranging from 51 mL ( glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD ) to 160 mL ( glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID ) . Pharmacodynamic steady - state was reached by Day 7 . There was a small separation ( ≤37 mL ) between BID and OD dose – response curves for mean trough FEV1 at steady - state in favour of BID dosing . Over 24 hours , separation between OD and BID regimens was even smaller ( FEV1 AUC0 - 24h maximum difference for equivalent daily dose regimens : 8 mL ) . Dose – response results for FEV1 at 12 hours , FEV1 AUC0 - 12h and FEV1 AUC0 - 4h at steady - state showed OD regimens provided greater improvement over placebo than BID regimens for total daily doses of 25 μg , 50 μg and 100 μg , while the reverse was true for OD versus BID regimens from 12–24 hours . The 12.5 μg BID dose produced a marginally higher improvement in trough FEV1 versus placebo than 50 μg OD , however , the response at 12 hours over placebo was suboptimal ( 74 mL ) . Glycopyrronium bromide was safe and well tolerated at all doses . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD provides significant bronchodilation over a 24 hour period , and in terms of FEV1 AUC0 - 24h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID . Importantly , OD dosing may confer better patient adherence . The results are consistent with previous glycopyrronium bromide studies and support once - daily dosing of glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : In an open - label randomized trial , HIV - infected patients were randomized to switch from zidovudine / lamivudine ( AZT/3TC ) to abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) or tenofovir / emtricitabine ( TDF / FTC ) . We measured bone mass density ( BMD ) and bone turnover biomarkers ( osteocalcin , osteocalcin , procollagen type 1 N - terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) , alkaline phosphatase , type I collagen cross - linked C - telopeptide ( CTx ) , and osteoprotegerin ) . We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance , plasma cystatin C , and urinary levels of creatinine , albumin , cystatin C , and neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of 40 included patients , 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up . BMD was measured in 33 , 26 , and 27 patients at baseline , week 24 , and week 48 , respectively . In TDF / FTC - treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 ( −1.8 % and −2.5 % ) and week 48 ( −2.1 % and −2.1 % ) , whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm . The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms . All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF / FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm , but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD . Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF - treated patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Switching to TDF / FTC - based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC - based treatment . No major difference in renal function was observed .

109,5754508_1,5754508,"TITLE : Macrophage activation marker sCD163 correlates with accelerated lipolysis following LPS exposure : a human - randomised clinical trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Macrophage activation determined by levels of soluble sCD163 is associated with obesity , insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus type 2 ( DM2 ) and non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . This suggests that macrophage activation is involved in the pathogenesis of conditions is characterised by adaptions in the lipid metabolism . Since sCD163 is shed to serum by inflammatory signals including lipopolysaccharides ( LPS , endotoxin ) , we investigated sCD163 and correlations with lipid metabolism following LPS exposure . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Eight healthy male subjects were investigated on two separate occasions : ( i ) following an LPS exposure and ( ii ) following saline exposure . Each study day consisted of a four - hour non - insulin - stimulated period followed by a two - hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp period . A 3H - palmitate tracer was used to calculate the rate of appearance ( Rapalmitate ) . Blood samples were consecutively obtained throughout each study day . Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained for western blotting . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We observed a significant two - fold increase in plasma sCD163 levels following LPS exposure ( P < 0.001 ) , and sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with the plasma concentration of free fatty acids , Rapalmitate , lipid oxidation rates and phosphorylation of the hormone - sensitive lipase at serine 660 in adipose tissue ( P < 0.05 , all ) . Furthermore , sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with plasma concentrations of cortisol , glucagon , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF)-α , interleukin ( IL)-6 and IL-10 ( P < 0.05 , all ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : We observed a strong correlation between sCD163 and stimulation of lipolysis and fat oxidation following LPS exposure . These findings support preexisting theory that inflammation and macrophage activation play a significant role in lipid metabolic adaptions under conditions such as obesity , DM2 and NAFLD .",attention,LPS exposure || placebo exposure || concentration of sCD163,"[(199, 261)]",1,dev,attention

Methods . A randomized , double - blind , double - dummy , active - controlled , two - period crossover study in adult patients receiving around - the - clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge . Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient . The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 ( moderate withdrawal ) or use of rescue medication . Results . 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal . One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50 % full μ - opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity . The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar , and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine . There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments . The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache ( 19 % ) , vomiting ( 13 % ) , nausea , diarrhea , and drug withdrawal syndrome ( each 9 % ) , and with full μ - opioid agonist were headache ( 16 % ) , drug withdrawal syndrome ( 13 % ) , and nausea ( 6 % ) . Conclusions . Chronic pain patients treated with around - the - clock full μ - opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine ( a partial μ - opioid agonist ) at approximately 50 % of the full μ - opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control .",attention,Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP) || Full μ-opioid agonist* || Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale(COWS) - 24-hour period,"[(202, 219)]",1,dev,attention

Telemonitoring has been proposed as a solution to this growing problem , but its impact on patient outcome is equivocal . This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate effectiveness of telemonitoring in improving COPD patient outcome . In total , 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring ( n = 53 ) or usual care ( n = 53 ) group . During the two months following discharge , telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary . The primary outcome measure was time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge . During the follow - up period , time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group ( p = 0.026 ) . Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all - cause re - admissions ( 0.23 vs. 0.68 / patient ; p = 0.002 ) and emergency room visits ( 0.36 vs. 0.91 / patient ; p = 0.006 ) . In conclusion , telemonitoring intervention was associated with improved outcomes among COPD patients admitted for exacerbation in a country characterized by a small territory and high accessibility to medical services . The findings are encouraging and add further support to implementation of telemonitoring as part of COPD care .",scaled attention,telemonitoring group || usual group || ER visits for all causes,"[(184, 226)]",3,dev,scaled attention
217,5346637_2,5346637,"TITLE : A randomized phase II trial comparing chemoimmunotherapy with or without bevacizumab in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ABSTRACT : Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) with in vitro pro - apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects on chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells . As monotherapy in patients with CLL , it has no clinical activity . Here we report the results of an open - label , randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin , cyclophosphamide and rituximab ( PCR ) either without or with bevacizumab ( PCR - B ) in previously untreated CLL patients . A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled , 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR - B. A higher rate of grade 3 - 4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR - B ( 33 % vs. 3 % , p < 0.003 ) . Patients treated with PCR - B had a trend for a higher complete remission ( CR ) rate ( 54.5 % vs 31.3 % ; p = 0.08 ) , longer progression - free survival ( PFS)(p = 0.06 ) and treatment - free survival ( TFS)(p = 0.09 ) . No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab . A significant post - treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR - B arm ( 29.77 to 57.05 pg / mL ) ; in the PCR - B arm , lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR ( p = 0.01 ) . In conclusion , the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well - tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS .",ig,chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (PCR-B) || chemoimmunotherapy without bevacizumab (PCR) || treatment-free survival (TFS),"[(155, 206)]",0,dev,ig
298,5207750_0,5207750,"TITLE : Intensive Patient Education Improves Glycaemic Control in Diabetes Compared to Conventional Education : A Randomised Controlled Trial in a Nigerian Tertiary Care Hospital ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Diabetes is now a global epidemic , but most cases are now in low- and middle - income countries . Diabetes self - management education ( DSME ) is key to enabling patients to manage their chronic condition and can reduce the occurrence of costly and devastating complications . However , there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of different DSME programmes in resource limited settings . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We conducted an unblinded , parallel - group , individually - randomised controlled trial at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital ( Nigeria ) to evaluate whether an intensive and systematic DSME programme , using structured guidelines , improved glycaemic control compared to the existing ad hoc patient education ( clinical practice was unchanged ) . Eligible patients ( ≥18 years , HbA1c > 8.5 % and physically able to participate ) were randomly allocated by permuted block randomisation to participate for six months in either an intensive or conventional education group . The primary outcome was HbA1c ( % ) at six - months . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We randomised 59 participants to each group and obtained six - month HbA1c outcomes from 53 and 51 participants in the intensive and conventional education groups , respectively . Intensive group participants had a mean six - month HbA1c ( % ) of 8.4 ( 95 % CI : 8 to 8.9 ) , while participants in the conventional education group had a mean six - month HbA1c ( % ) of 10.2 ( 95 % CI : 9.8 to 10.7 ) . The difference was statistically ( P < 0.0001 ) and clinically significant , with intensive group participants having HbA1c outcomes on average -1.8 ( 95 % CI : -2.4 to -1.2 ) percentage points lower than conventional group participants . Results were robust to adjustment for a range of covariates and multiple imputation of missing outcome data . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a structured , guideline - based DSME intervention in a LMIC setting versus a pragmatic comparator . The intervention is potentially replicable at other levels of the Nigerian healthcare system and in other LMICs , where nurses / diabetes educators can run the programme .

SASA ! , a phased community mobilization intervention , engages communities to prevent IPV and promote gender equity . The SASA ! study assessed the community - level impact of SASA ! on reported HIV - related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Data were collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2012 in eight communities in Kampala . An adjusted cluster - level intention to treat analysis , compares secondary outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow - up . The qualitative evaluation explored participants ' subjective experience of SASA ! . A total of 82 in - depth interviews were audio recorded at follow - up , transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV - protective behaviours , including higher levels of condom use ( aRR 2.03 , 95 % CI 1.22–3.39 ) , HIV testing ( aRR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.13–2.00 ) and fewer concurrent partners ( aRR 0.60 , 95 % CI 0.37–0.97 ) . They were also more likely to report increased joint decision - making ( aRR 1.92 , 95 % CI 1.27–2.91 ) , greater male participation in household tasks ( aRR 1.48 , 95 % CI 1.09–2.01 ) , more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner 's work inside ( aRR 1.31 , 95 % CI 1.04–1.66 ) and outside ( aRR 1.49 , 95 % CI 1.08–2.06 ) the home . For women , all outcomes were in the hypothesized direction , but effect sizes were smaller . Only some achieved statistical significance . Women in intervention communities were significantly more likely to report being able to refuse sex with their partners ( aRR 1.16 , 95 % CI 1.00–1.35 ) , joint decision - making ( aRR 1.37 , 95 % CI 1.06–1.78 ) and more open communication on a number of indicators . Qualitative interviews suggest that shifts operated through broader improvements in relationships , including increased trust and cooperation , participants ' greater awareness of the connections between HIV and IPV and their resultant desire to improve their relationships . Barriers to change include partial uptake of SASA ! , partner resistance , fear and entrenched previous beliefs .

We developed a highly - structured manualized eight - session cognitive - behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists ( tCBT ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We conducted a parallel - group , non - blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre - existing Employee Assistance Program ( EAP ) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan . The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory - II ( BDI - II ) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire ( HPQ ) . In the course of the trial the follow - up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual . Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP ( n = 58 ) and to EAP alone ( n = 60 ) . The BDI - II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months ( p<0.001 , Effect size = 0.69 , 95%CI : 0.32 to 1.05 ) .

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH , delivered as an extract of un - ripened avocado , on energy expenditure ( EE ) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs ( total of 12 dogs , 26.99 ± 0.634 kg , 4.9 ± 0.2 y ) . The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) .

Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",attention,Mannoheptulose || Control || Post-prandial respiratory quotient,"[(258, 287)]",1,dev,attention

An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP , however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL .

179,5584005_6,5584005,"TITLE : Evaluation of a guided continuous quality improvement program in community pharmacies ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The importance of creating and sustaining a strong culture of patient safety has been recognized as a critical component of safe medication use . This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Guided CQI program implementation increased the self - reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff .

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : To report the 12-month extension of a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy , safety and tolerability of atorvastatin 40 mg / d added to interferon beta-1b ( IFNB-1b ) in relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In the randomized , multicenter , parallel - group , rater - blinded core study , 77 RRMS patients started IFNB-1b . At month three they were randomized 1∶1 to receive atorvastatin 40 mg / d or not in addition to IFNB-1b until month 15 . In the subsequent extension study , patients continued with unchanged medication for another 12 months . Data at study end were compared to data at month three of the core study . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 27 of 72 patients that finished the core study entered the extension study . 45 patients were lost mainly due to a safety analysis during the core study including a recruitment stop for the extension study . The primary end point , the proportion of patients with new lesions on T2-weighted images was equal in both groups ( odds ratio 1.926 ; 95 % CI 0.265–14.0007 ; p = 0.51 ) . All secondary endpoints including number of new lesions and total lesion volume on T2-weighted images , total number of Gd - enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images , volume of grey and white matter , EDSS , MSFC , relapse rate , number of relapse - free patients and neutralizing antibodies did not show significant differences either .

352,3750227_4,3750227,"TITLE : Risk of hyperkalemia in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease initiating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers : a randomized study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are renoprotective but both may increase serum potassium concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The proportion of affected patients , the optimum follow - up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , phase IV , controlled , crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control . With the exception of withdrawals , each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each , with a 1-week wash - out period between treatments . Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples . We used the Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups . Comparisons were also made using independent two - sample t - tests and Welch 's t - test . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed when necessary . We used either a Mann – Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly ( 0.3 mmol / L and 0.24 mmol / L respectively ) . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol / L did not differ between treatments : 37 % for olmesartan and 40 % for enalapril . The mean e - GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study . The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar ( 23 % in olmesartan and 29 % in enalapril patients ) in the 4 weeks time point . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia , even after a two month period , did not differ between treatments . There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups . The follow - up of these patients should include control of potassium levels , at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment .

302,5156604_3,5156604,"TITLE : Memorizing fruit : The effect of a fruit memory - game on children 's fruit intake ABSTRACT : Food cues of palatable food are omnipresent , thereby simulating the intake of unhealthy snack food among children . As a consequence , this might lead to a higher intake of energy - dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables , a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases . The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children . We used a randomized between - subject design with 127 children ( age : 7–12 y ) who played a memory - game , containing either fruit ( n = 64 ) or non - food products ( n = 63 ) . While playing the memory - game in a separate room in school during school hours , free intake of fruit ( mandarins , apples , bananas , and grapes ) was measured . Afterwards , the children completed self - report measures , and length and weight were assessed . The main finding is that playing a memory - game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake ( P = 0.016 ) . Children who played the fruit version of the memory - game ate more bananas ( P = 0.015 ) and mandarins ( P = 0.036 ) than children who played the non - food memory - game ; no effects were found for apples ( P > 0.05 ) and grapes ( P > 0.05 ) . The findings suggest that playing a memory - game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children . This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit , according to international standards , and more traditional health interventions have limited success . Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults , making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way .

One reason would be the mother 's desire . Increased maternal self - efficacy can be an important step to reduce percentage of cesarean . This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of training - based strategies to increase the self - efficacy for choosing delivery method among pregnant women in Shahrekord city . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : This quasi - experimental study was conducted on 130 pregnant women who attended urban health centers in Shahrekord city in 2013 . Intervention was applied in the experimental group in three sessions in about 60 - 90 min while control group did not receive any intervention . Fear of childbirth and self - efficacy questionnaire was completed before and after training . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : While mean scores of the fear of childbirth , expectations and childbirth self - efficacy before the intervention between the two groups were not significantly different ( P > 0.05 ) , mean scores of childbirth in intervention group was reduced and expectation and childbirth self - efficacy had a significant increase after intervention ( P < 0.05 ) . In this study , 71.4 % of mothers in intervention group and 53.8 % of control mothers naturally delivered their children . Most of intervention group mothers desired to deliver through cesarean and had more fear ( P < 0.001 ) but lower childbirth expectation ( P > 0.05 ) and self - efficacy ( P < 0.001 ) than those who chose normal method . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : Our findings showed that training - based self - efficacy procedure has been effective in encouraging mothers to choose natural childbirth . Therefore , the design and implementation of curriculum - based strategies for increasing self - efficacy is suggested for pregnant women .",ig,Training-based strategies (experimental group) || No intervention (control group) || Means scores of expectations and childbirth self-efficacy,"[(190, 217)]",0,dev,ig

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity . The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline .",attention,Prolonged-release melatonin || Placebo || Adverse events,"[(418, 443)]",1,dev,attention

295,3897026_5,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period . We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats ( > 200 gr , > 6 week ) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model . Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin ( OC ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period . The results were analyzed and compared between groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups , their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group .

542,3460347_1,3460347,"TITLE : Nicotine , Auditory Sensory Memory , and ABSTRACT : Background : The procognitive actions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) agonist nicotine are believed , in part , to motivate the excessive cigarette smoking in schizophrenia , a disorder associated with deficits in multiple cognitive domains , including low - level auditory sensory processes and higher - order attention - dependent operations . Objectives : As N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) hypofunction has been shown to contribute to these cognitive impairments , the primary aims of this healthy volunteer study were to : ( a ) to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of nAChR and NMDAR systems in the modulation of auditory sensory memory ( and sustained attention ) , as indexed by the auditory event - related brain potential – mismatch negativity ( MMN ) , and ( b ) to examine how these effects are moderated by a predisposition to auditory hallucinations / delusions ( HD ) . Methods : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled design involving a low intravenous dose of ketamine ( 0.04 mg / kg ) and a 4 mg dose of nicotine gum , MMN , and performance on a rapid visual information processing ( RVIP ) task of sustained attention were examined in 24 healthy controls psychometrically stratified as being lower ( L - HD , n = 12 ) or higher ( H - HD ) for HD propensity . Results : Ketamine significantly slowed MMN , and reduced MMN in H - HD , with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co - administration of nicotine . Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [ reaction time ( RT ) ] and accuracy ( increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms ) on the RVIP , with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine . Both % hits and d′ , as well as RT were poorer in H - HD ( vs. L - HD ) and while hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H - HD , RT was slowed by ketamine in L - HD . Conclusions : Nicotine alleviated ketamine - induced sensory memory impairment and improved attention , particularly in individuals prone to HD .",scaled attention,(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg) || (NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum || hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD),"[(259, 285)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Its therapeutic approach is challenging as the first line treatment often does not help , or even causes intolerable side effects . The aim of our randomized double blind , placebo controlled , crossover study was to investigate in a prospective way the effect of lidocaine in patients with trigeminal neuralgia . Twenty patients met our inclusion criteria and completed the study . Each patient underwent four weekly sessions , two of which were with lidocaine ( 5 mgs / kg ) and two with placebo infusions administered over 60 minutes . Intravenous lidocaine was superior regarding the reduction of the intensity of pain , the allodynia , and the hyperalgesia compared to placebo . Moreover , contrary to placebo , lidocaine managed to maintain its therapeutic results for the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion . Although , intravenous lidocaine is not a first line treatment , when first line medications fail to help , pain specialists may try it as an add - on treatment .

The optimum fluid regimen has not been established . This prospective , randomized , blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid ( hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution ( Hartmann 's Solution ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid ( N = 60 ) or crystalloid ( N = 60 ) intra - operatively . The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting . Patients were interviewed to assess nausea , vomiting , anti - emetic use , dizziness , sore throat , headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2 , 24 and 48 hours post operatively . Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea ( 38.2 % vs 17.9 % , P = 0.03 ) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively ( 1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2 , P = 0.028 ) . The incidence of vomiting and anti - emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups . Sore throat , dizziness , headache and general well being were not different between the groups . A comparable reduction on post - operative FVC and FEV-1 and PEFR was observed in both groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intra - operative administration of colloid increased the incidence of early postoperative nausea and has no advantage over crystalloid for symptom control after gynaecological laparoscopic surgery .",ig,Intravenous colloid || Intravenous crystalloid || Use of anti-emetic drugs,"[(224, 243)]",0,dev,ig

Previous studies emphasized cellular immune responses ; however , current research suggests both cellular and humoral responses are likely required for a successful therapeutic vaccine . Thus , we aimed to understand antibody response and function induced by vaccination of ART - treated HIV-1-infected patients with immune recovery . All subjects participated in EraMune 02 , an open - label randomized clinical trial of ART intensification followed by a six plasmid DNA prime ( envA , envB , envC , gagB , polB , nefB ) and rAd5 boost HIV vaccine with matching inserts . Antibody binding levels were determined with a recently developed microarray approach . We also analyzed neutralization efficiency and antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . We found that the DNA prime - rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross - clade HIV - specific antibody response , which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency . However , despite the increase in antibody binding levels , the vaccine did not significantly stimulate neutralization or ADCC responses . This finding was also reflected by a lack of change in total CD4 + cell associated HIV DNA in those who received the vaccine . Our results have important implications for further therapeutic vaccine design and administration , especially in HIV-1 infected patients , as boosting of preexisting antibody responses are unlikely to lead to clearance of latent proviruses in the HIV reservoir .",gradients,DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine || Control || HIV-specific antibody response,"[(183, 212)]",4,dev,gradients

ABSTRACT.METHODS : The Prospective , Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory ( PROSPER ) study was a multinational , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group Phase 3 study . The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly ( 28-day ) seizure frequency for the 16-week double - blind treatment period in the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population with analyzable seizure data . Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50 % seizure reduction , proportion of patients seizure free , and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Median percent reduction was -28.7 % for placebo , −38.2 % ( P = 0.08 vs placebo ) for once - daily SPN-804 1200 mg , and −42.9 % ( P = 0.003 ) for SPN-804 2400 mg . Responder rates were 28.1 % , 36.1 % ( P = 0.08 ) , and 40.7 % ( P = 0.02 ) ; 16-week seizure - free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3 % , 4.9 % ( P = 0.59 ) , and 11.4 % ( P = 0.008 ) , respectively . When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters , a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction ( placebo : −13.3 % ; 1200 mg : −34.5 % , P = 0.02 ; 2400 mg : −52.7 % , P = 0.006 ) in the North American study site cluster . A concentration – response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg . Adverse event types reflected the drug 's established profile . Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate - release OXC . Once - daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Adjunctive once - daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial - onset seizures . Adverse event occurrence and discontinuations due to adverse events suggest improved tolerability vs previously published data with immediate - release OXC .",scaled attention,Extended-release oxcarbazepine 2400 mg || Control || Seizure median percent improvement in North America,"[(319, 365)]",3,dev,scaled attention
296,3897026_6,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

The attentional costs of such multitasking may vary depending on the ebb and flow of the social media channel , such as its emotional contents . In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that negative social media messages would draw more attention than similar positive messages . Specifically , news broadcasts were presented in isolation and with simultaneous positive or negative Twitter messages on a tablet to 38 participants in a controlled experiment . Recognition memory , gaze tracking , cardiac responses , and self - reports were used as attentional indices . The presence of any tweets on the tablet decreased attention to the news broadcasts . As expected , negative tweets drew longer viewing times and elicited more attention to themselves than positive tweets . Negative tweets did not , however , decrease attention to the news broadcasts . Taken together , the present results demonstrate a negativity bias exists for social media messages in media multitasking ; however , this effect does not amplify the overall detrimental effects of media multitasking .",scaled attention,positive Twitter messages || negative Twitter messages || viewing times,"[(168, 187)]",3,dev,scaled attention
176,5584005_3,5584005,"TITLE : Evaluation of a guided continuous quality improvement program in community pharmacies ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The importance of creating and sustaining a strong culture of patient safety has been recognized as a critical component of safe medication use . This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) .

A recent study speculated that anesthesia induction using propofol 2 mg / kg transiently reduced left ventricular ( LV ) contraction by analyzing tissue Doppler - derived imaging ( TDI ) during induction phase . The purpose of this study was to analyze and to compare the impacts of propofol- and thiopental - induction on LV function . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four female patients with normal LV function undergoing non - cardiac surgery were randomly administered intravenous bolus thiopental ( 5 mg / kg , Thiopental - group , n = 12 ) or propofol ( 2 mg / kg , Propofol - group , n = 12 ) for anesthesia - induction . TDI of septal mitral annular velocity during systole ( S ' ) , early diastole ( e ' ) and atrial contraction ( a ' ) were determined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 , 3 , and 5 minutes after thiopental / propofol administration ( T0 , T1 , T2 , and T3 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The bispectral index and systolic blood pressure declined significantly during anesthesia induction in both groups , however , more depressed in Thiopental - group compared with those in Propofol - group at T2 and T3 ( all , p < 0.05 ) . Among TDI two parameters demonstrated a significant inter - group difference : the S ' in propofol was lower than that in Thiopental - group at T3 ( p = 0.002 ) , and a ' velocities were persistently lower in Propofol - group , compared with same time values in Thiopental - group ( T1 , T2 , and T3 : p = 0.025 , 0.007 , and 0.009 , respectively ) .

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) .

This post hoc analysis of three randomized trials evaluated whether disease duration affected responses to pramlintide . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Patients received mealtime pramlintide 30 or 60 μg ( n = 714 ) or placebo ( n = 537 ) as an adjunct to insulin and were stratified into tertiles by diabetes duration at baseline . Efficacy and safety end points were assessed at week 26 using analysis of covariance and logistic regression models . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Disease durations for tertiles 1 , 2 , and 3 were 6.7 , 16.5 , and 29.9 years , respectively . In all tertiles , pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and weight than placebo , with greater weight reductions and insulin sparing in tertiles 2 and 3 . Insulin dose and weight increased in the placebo group in all tertiles . Baseline HbA1c was a predictor of HbA1c lowering in both treatment groups ( P < 0.0001 ) ; higher daily insulin predicted a smaller percent increase in insulin dose for placebo ( P = 0.01 ) ; and higher body weight predicted greater weight loss in both pramlintide- and placebo - treated patients ( P < 0.05 ) . Event rates for severe hypoglycemia were similar for pramlintide and placebo and increased with longer duration of diabetes for both groups . Nausea with pramlintide increased with longer disease duration . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Mealtime pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c than placebo , regardless of diabetes duration at baseline .

This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) .

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity .

The proportion of affected patients , the optimum follow - up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , phase IV , controlled , crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control . With the exception of withdrawals , each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each , with a 1-week wash - out period between treatments . Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples . We used the Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups . Comparisons were also made using independent two - sample t - tests and Welch 's t - test . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed when necessary . We used either a Mann – Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly ( 0.3 mmol / L and 0.24 mmol / L respectively ) . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol / L did not differ between treatments : 37 % for olmesartan and 40 % for enalapril . The mean e - GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study . The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar ( 23 % in olmesartan and 29 % in enalapril patients ) in the 4 weeks time point . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia , even after a two month period , did not differ between treatments . There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) .

This 12-week , double - blind study compared the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 ( mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post - dose ) at Week 12 ( primary endpoint ) and after Day 1 , and the percentage of COPD days with poor control ( i.e. , worsening symptoms ) . Safety was assessed by adverse events ( AEs ) , mean serum potassium and blood glucose , QTc ( Fridericia ) , and vital signs . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients were randomised ( n = 416 , mean age 63 years ) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d . ( n = 211 ) or placebo ( n = 205 ) via a single - dose dry - powder inhaler ; 87.5 % completed the study . Trough FEV1 ( LSM ± SEM ) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo , a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL ( p < 0.001 ) . Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) . Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo , both on Day 1 and at Week 12 , with indacaterol - placebo differences ( LSM ± SEM ) of 190 ± 28 ( p < 0.001 ) and 160 ± 28 mL ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 ( between 5 min and 4 h , 5 min and 1 h , and 1 and 4 h post - dose ) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) , with LSM ( ± SEM ) differences of 170 ± 24 , 180 ± 24 , and 170 ± 24 mL , respectively . Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5 % ( p < 0.001 ) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication ( p < 0.001 ) . The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups ( indacaterol 49.3 % , placebo 46.8 % ) , with the most common AEs being COPD worsening ( indacaterol 8.5 % , placebo 12.2 % ) and cough ( indacaterol 6.2 % , placebo 7.3 % ) . One patient died in the placebo group . Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups , and no patient had QTc > 500 ms . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Indacaterol 150 μg o.d . provided clinically significant and sustained bronchodilation , reduced rescue medication use , and had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo .

286,4015738_0,4015738,"TITLE : Effects of two different strategies of fluid administration on inflammatory mediators , plasma electrolytes and acid / base disorders in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery : a randomized double blind study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Administration of normal saline might increase circulating levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and may cause variation of plasmatic electrolytic and hyperchloremic acidosis , which in turn can impair renal function . Hence the use of balanced solutions could influence the inflammatory cascade triggered by the surgical procedures , the plasmatic electrolyte concentration , the acid – base equilibrium , and the renal function . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This is a double blind randomized trial . Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery ( bowel cancer ) were allocated in two groups , the balanced solution ( BS ) group in which the fluids administered were balanced solutions ( colloids and crystalloids ) ; and the unbalanced solution ( UBS ) group in which the fluids administered were unbalanced solutions ( colloids and crystalloids ) . Measurements were performed after anaesthesia induction ( T0 ) , at the end of surgery ( T1 ) , within 2 h after surgery ( T2 ) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery ( T3 ) . The following data were collected : 1 ) active matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and its tissue inhibitor ( TIMP-1 ) , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 ; 2 ) blood gases variables ; 3 ) electrolytes , albumin , total serum protein and the strong ion difference ; 4 ) neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) from urinary sample . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The BS group exhibited higher circulating level of IL-10 and TIMP-1 and lower level of active MMP-9 . The UBS group experienced hypercloremia , hypocalcemia , hypomagnesemia , worse acid – base equilibrium and higher level of NGAL . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The use of balanced solutions was responsible of less alteration of plasmatic electrolytes , acid – base equilibrium , kidney function and it might be associated with an early anti - inflammatory mechanisms triggering .

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different pre - treatments ( ethanol , ethylene de amine tetra acetic acid [ EDTA ] and EDTA + ethanol ) on the bond strength of adhesively lutted tooth colored fiber post . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : Forty - eight human anterior teeth ( incisor and canine ) were selected in this experimental study . The species were endodontically treated , and the post - space was prepared . The species were randomly divided into four groups of 12 teeth in each and were treated as follows : ( i ) 0.1 M EDTA , ( ii ) 99.6 % ethanol , ( iii ) 0.1 M EDTA followed by 99.6 % ethanol and ( iv ) without any treatment ( control ) . A push - out test was carried out after 24 h. Each tooth was cut into three 1 mm - thick sections . Fracture type was assessed using stereomicroscope . The data were analyzed by one way - ANOVA followed by Scheffe post - hoc test at P = 0.05 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Almost , in EDTA and ( EDTA + ethanol ) every sample failed at the interface between post and lutting cement .

517,3916855_6,3916855,"TITLE : Effects of Vitamin A Supplementation on Iron Status Indices and Iron Deficiency Anaemia : A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : Iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world including developed and developing countries . Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",gradients,vitamin A group || placebo group || transferrin saturation,"[(208, 256)]",4,dev,gradients
