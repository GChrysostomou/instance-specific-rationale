108,108,5541727_4,5541727,"TITLE : Safety , tolerability , clinical , and joint structural outcomes of a single intra - articular injection of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells in patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction : a controlled double - blind randomised trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Few clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for the management of post - traumatic osteoarthritis . The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of a single intra - articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells ( MPCs ) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In this phase Ib / IIa , double - blind , active comparator clinical study , 17 patients aged 18–40 years with unilateral ACL reconstruction were randomized ( 2:1 ) to receive either a single intra - articular injection of 75 million allogeneic MPCs suspended in hyaluronan ( HA ) ( MPC + HA group ) ( n = 11 ) or HA alone ( n = 6 ) . Patients were monitored for adverse events . Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti - HLA panel reactive antibodies ( PRA ) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry . Pain , function , and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) and SF-36v2 scores . Joint space width was measured from radiographs , and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + HA group and 0 out of 6 HA controls . No cell - related serious adverse effects were observed . Increases in class I PRA > 10 % were observed at week 4 in the MPC + HA group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104 . Compared with the HA group , MPC + HA - treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain , symptom , activities of daily living , and SF-36 bodily pain scores ( p < 0.05 ) . The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing ( p < 0.05 ) , less tibial bone expansion ( 0.5 % vs 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.02 ) , and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss ( 0.7 % vs – 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.10 ) than the HA controls . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intra - articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following ACL reconstruction was safe , well tolerated , and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes . These findings suggest that MPCs warrant further investigations as they may modulate some of the pathological processes responsible for the development of post - traumatic osteoarthritis following ACL reconstruction .

This study was conducted to assess the effects of prenatal education on mothers ' stress and labor . This clinical trial was conducted to study 195 women ( 132 in the control group and 63 in the experimental group ) who had attended healthcare centers in the city of Amol after their 16th gestational week . The experimental group participated in educational classes to learn how to experience a safe childbirth for 6 - 8 sessions of 1.5 hours almost every three weeks . The control group received only a routine care , pain assessment scales like Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and McGill questionnaire , and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) were employed to collect data . The data were analyzed using SPSS software through t - test and Chi Square test to compare the groups . The results of the t - test showed a meaningful difference in levels of stress felt by the experimental group compared to control group ( p=0.002 ) . The Visual Analogue Scale suggested that in the transitional stages ( 8 - 10 cm cervical dilation ) , the level of pain felt by the experimental group was meaningfully lower than that felt by the control group ( p=0.03 ) . However , this was not significantly different between the two groups at 3 - 4 cm cervical dilation and the second stage of childbirth . The McGill scale 's results for measuring pain levels , proved a meaningful difference between the experimental group and the control group ( p=0.018 ) .

332,332,4274041_6,4274041,"TITLE : Impact of crystal polymorphism on the systemic bioavailability of rifaximin , an antibiotic acting locally in the gastrointestinal tract , in healthy volunteers ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Rifaximin is an antibiotic , acting locally in the gastrointestinal tract , which may exist in different crystal as well as amorphous forms . The current marketed rifaximin formulation contains polymorph alpha , the systemic bioavailability of which is very limited . This study compared the pharmacokinetics of this formulation with those of the amorphous form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Amorphous rifaximin was specifically prepared for the study and formulated as the marketed product . Two doses ( 200 mg and 400 mg ) of both formulations were given to two groups of 12 healthy volunteers of either sex according to a single - blind , randomized , two - treatment , single - dose , two - period , cross - over design . Plasma and urine samples were collected at preset times ( for 24 hours or 48 hours , respectively ) after dosing , and assayed for rifaximin concentrations by high - performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : For both dose levels , peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and cumulative urinary excretion were significantly higher after administration of amorphous rifaximin than rifaximin - α . Ninety percent confidence intervals for peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and urinary excretion ratios were largely outside the upper limit of the accepted ( 0.80–1.25 ) range , indicating higher systemic bioavailability of the amorphous rifaximin . The few adverse events recorded were not serious and not related to the study medications . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Rifaximin - α , a crystal polymorph , does differ from the amorphous form , the latter being systemically more bioavailable . In this regard , care must be taken when using – as a medicinal product – a formulation containing even small amounts of amorphous form , which may alter the peculiar pharmacologic properties of this poorly absorbed antibiotic .",attention,Polymorph alpha rifaximin 200 mg || Amorphous rifaximin 200 mg || Cumulative urinary excretion,"[(190, 223)]",1,dev,ig

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled in this prospective , randomized , double - blind study . Four types of medications were applied in their nostrils with binary combinations of spray bottles on four different days in a random order : placebo ( normal saline [ NS]+NS ) , decongestant ( NS+oxymetazoline ) , anesthetic ( NS+lidocaine ) , and decongestant plus anesthetic ( oxymetazoline+lidocaine ) . Rigid nasal endoscopy was performed 10 minutes after spray application . The volunteers evaluated the discomfort caused by each spray application , and nasal pain scores due to the passage of the endoscope . The physicians quantified nasal decongestion using a visual analogue scale . Endoscopy duration as well as pulse and mean blood pressure ( MBP ) before spray application , 10 minutes after the application , and immediately after endoscopic examination were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The discomfort caused by lidocaine was significantly higher than that caused by the other sprays ( P<0.001 ) . The lowest pain score related to endoscopy was obtained for oxymetazoline+lidocaine ( P<0.001 ) . Nasal decongestion was best achieved with NS+oxymetazoline ( P<0.001 ) . Endoscopy duration was the shortest for oxymetazoline+ lidocaine ( P<0.05 ) . Statistically significant MBP changes were only seen with the application of NS+oxymetazoline ( P<0.05 ) .

457,457,4336131_2,4336131,"TITLE : Effects of Rikkunshito ( traditional Japanese medicine ) on enteral feeding and the plasma ghrelin level in critically ill patients : a pilot study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Rikkunshito is a traditional Japanese medicine that has been widely prescribed for patients with various gastrointestinal symptoms . Recently , the prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito in patients with a variety of diseases have attracted attention in Japan . The prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito are believed to result from an increase of active ghrelin , which is most abundant in the stomach and which has a gastrokinetic function . The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effects of Rikkunshito on intragastric enteral feeding and plasma ghrelin levels in critically ill patients . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The study population consisted of critically ill patients who were projected to require intragastric tube feeding for more than 7 days . The patients were prospectively assigned to one of two treatment groups and were randomized to receive either Rikkunshito ( 2.5 g ) or metoclopramide ( 10 mg ) every 8 h. All patients received standard enteral nutrition . Patients in both groups were begun on intragastric tube feeding according to our institution 's feeding protocol . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : All patients were undergoing mechanical ventilation at the time of enrollment . The portions of enteral nutrition provided to the target amount and the quantity of gastric discharge were not statistically significantly different between the two groups . The Rikkunshito group reached 50 % of the target amount of enteral feeding significantly earlier than the metoclopramide group , although the proportion of patients in whom enteral feeding was successful did not differ significantly between the two groups . Patients in the Rikkunshito group showed significantly higher plasma levels of active ghrelin compared to those in the metoclopramide group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The administration of Rikkunshito increased the plasma level of active ghrelin , and induced prokinetic effects that were greater than those observed following treatment with metoclopramide in critically ill patients .

The subjects randomly received PEG PM dose ; 4 liters of water plus 4 pack PEG powder at 6 pm before colonoscopy ( 250 ml every 15 min ) or AM ( the same dose solution at 6 am on the day of colonoscopy ) . The preparation and colonoscopy quality , PEG side effects , sleep quality , lesion detection , flush need and suction fluid were compared in these two groups . Results : One hundred seven cases received AM prep and 102 received PM prep . The colon prep was adequate in 94.4 % in AM group and in 90.2 % cases in PM group ( P=0.2 ) . The incidence of adverse events in these two groups was similar . Sleep quality and the need for flush was lower in the AM group ( P=0.004 and P=0.03 ) . The mean volume of suction fluid was higher in the AM group ( P=0.01 ) . The detected lesions were similar between the two groups . Adequate prep was associated with lower flush need in AM group ( P=0.001 ) . Conclusion : AM and PM PEG solutions were clinically equivalent with cleansing efficacy and side effect and lesion detection . AM group was associated with a better sleep quality and less flush need , but more suction fluid .",scaled attention,morning (AM) PEG (polyethylene glycol) solution || previous-evening (PM) PEG solutio || suction fluid during the procedure,"[(228, 244)]",2,dev,gradients

At the moment , however , there are no data suggesting the better control of once - daily fixed ( Fixed ) over free doses in separate administrations combination therapy in hypertensives . In a population of 39 consecutive outpatient patients referred to the departmental Hypertension clinic of the University Hospital of Salerno Medical School with the first diagnosis of arterial hypertension , we tested the hypothesis that the Fixed achieve a better control of blood pressure than the Free combination . Patients were randomized to either strategy and after 3 months patients underwent a clinical assessment to evaluate the antihypertensive effect . The two groups , matched for anthropometric and clinical parameters , received Amlodipine ( 5–10 mg / daily ) and Perindopril ( 5–10 mg / daily ) . Perindopril and Amlodipine doses did not significantly differ between the two groups . After 3 months BP control was improved in both groups and BP targets were similarly reached in both groups ( SBP ; Fixed : 61.54 % ; Free 69.23 % ; n.s . DPB ; Fixed : 80.77 % ; Free 84.62 % ; n.s . ) . The reduction in systolic blood pressure was similar in both groups ( Fixed:7.64±2.49 % ; Free : 7.81±4.00 % , n.s . ) , while the reduction of diastolic blood pressure was greater in the Fixed group ( Fixed : 14.22±2.03 % ; Free : 4.92±5.00 % , p<0.05 ) . Although both strategies are effective in reducing BP , the use of Fixed dose has an advantage in the reduction of BP . The present study does not allow to identify the mechanisms of this difference , which can be assumed to be due to the pharmacokinetics of the drugs administered in once - daily fixed combination .",attention,ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist fixed dose || ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist free dose || Reaching blood pressure target,"[(191, 239)]",1,dev,scaled attention

Because of the practical difficulties encountered in improving the nutritional adequacy of traditional complementary foods and the limitations associated with the use of liquid iron supplementation for the treatment and prevention of IDA in infants and young children , recently , home - fortification with multivitamins and minerals sprinkles was recommended . This study aims to compare the effect of twice weekly versus daily supplementation with multivitamins and minerals powder ( MMP ) on anaemia prevalence , haemoglobin concentration , and growth in infants and young children in a rural community in Lao PDR . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A randomized trial was conducted in six rural communities . Children aged 6 to 52 months ( n = 336 ) were randomly assigned to a control group ( n = 110 ) or to one of two intervention groups receiving either two sachets per week ( n = 115 ) or a daily sachet ( n = 111 ) of MMP for 24 weeks ; 331 children completed the study . A finger prick of blood was taken at baseline , at week 12 , and again at week 24 to determine haemoglobin concentration . Anthropometric measurements were taken every 4 weeks . The McNemar test was used to assess within group differences at three time points in the study subjects with anaemia and one - way ANOVA was used to assess changes in mean haemoglobin concentration in the treatment groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : MMP supplementation resulted in significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration and in the reduction of anaemia prevalence in the two treatment groups compared with the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . The severely to moderately anaemic children ( Hb < 100 g / L ) on daily supplementation recovered faster than those on twice weekly supplementation . MMP was well accepted and compliance was high in both treatment groups . Overall , the improvement in the weight for age Z - score was very small and not statistically significant across the three study groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : MMP supplementation had positive effects in reduction of anaemia prevalence and in improving haemoglobin concentration . For severely to moderately anaemic children , daily MMP supplementation was more effective in improving haemoglobin concentration and reducing anaemia prevalence . A longer intervention period is probably needed to have a positive effect on growth .",attention,Multivitamins and minerals - 2 sachets per week || Control || Haemoglobin,"[(306, 337)]",1,dev,ig

326,326,4274041_0,4274041,"TITLE : Impact of crystal polymorphism on the systemic bioavailability of rifaximin , an antibiotic acting locally in the gastrointestinal tract , in healthy volunteers ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Rifaximin is an antibiotic , acting locally in the gastrointestinal tract , which may exist in different crystal as well as amorphous forms . The current marketed rifaximin formulation contains polymorph alpha , the systemic bioavailability of which is very limited . This study compared the pharmacokinetics of this formulation with those of the amorphous form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Amorphous rifaximin was specifically prepared for the study and formulated as the marketed product . Two doses ( 200 mg and 400 mg ) of both formulations were given to two groups of 12 healthy volunteers of either sex according to a single - blind , randomized , two - treatment , single - dose , two - period , cross - over design . Plasma and urine samples were collected at preset times ( for 24 hours or 48 hours , respectively ) after dosing , and assayed for rifaximin concentrations by high - performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : For both dose levels , peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and cumulative urinary excretion were significantly higher after administration of amorphous rifaximin than rifaximin - α . Ninety percent confidence intervals for peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and urinary excretion ratios were largely outside the upper limit of the accepted ( 0.80–1.25 ) range , indicating higher systemic bioavailability of the amorphous rifaximin . The few adverse events recorded were not serious and not related to the study medications . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Rifaximin - α , a crystal polymorph , does differ from the amorphous form , the latter being systemically more bioavailable . In this regard , care must be taken when using – as a medicinal product – a formulation containing even small amounts of amorphous form , which may alter the peculiar pharmacologic properties of this poorly absorbed antibiotic .",others,Polymorph alpha rifaximin 400 mg || Amorphous rifaximin 400 mg || Rifaximin peak plasma concentration,"[(190, 223)]",0,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Data were collected from 48 participants in the following demographically matched groups : patients with chronic pain ( n=36 ) and healthy controls ( n=12 ) . Participants underwent a series of Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) procedures assessing responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli during two separate visits , in a randomized order . One visit consisted of standard , moderately painful QST procedures , while the other visit involved nonpainful analogs to these testing procedures . Blood samples were taken at baseline , and then for up to 2 hours after QST in order to study the time course of IL-6 responses . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Results of multilevel analyses revealed that IL-6 responses increased across assessment time points in both visits ( p<0.001 ) . While patients with chronic pain and healthy controls did not differ in the magnitude of IL-6 responses , psychological factors influenced IL-6 trajectories only in the chronic pain group . Among patients , increases in catastrophizing over the course of the QST session were associated with elevated IL-6 responses only during the painful QST session ( p<0.05 ) . When controlling for anxiety , results indicated that the main multilevel model among patients remained significant ( p<0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Under specific conditions ( eg , application of a painful stressor ) , catastrophizing may be associated with amplified proinflammatory responses in patients with persistent pain . These findings suggest that psychosocial interventions that reduce negative pain - related cognitions may benefit patients ' inflammatory profiles .",attention,moderately painful Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures || baseline || IL-6 responses,"[(212, 238)]",1,dev,ig

Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey ( WPC-80 ) . This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2 × 20 g of native whey protein , WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind , randomized , partial crossover , controlled study . Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey ( n = 10 ) , in a crossover design , or milk ( n = 12 ) . Supplements were ingested immediately ( 20 g ) and two hours after ( 20 g ) a bout of heavy - load lower body resistance exercise . Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas - chromatography mass spectrometry , muscle phosphorylation of p70S6 K , 4E – BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting , and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [ 2H5]phenylalanine - infusion , gas - chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope - ratio mass spectrometry . Being the main comparison , differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one - way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two - way ANOVA . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk ( P < 0.05 ) . Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6 K than milk 180 min after exercise ( P = 0.03 ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1–3 h hours after exercise with WPC-80 ( 0.119 % ) , and 1–5 h after exercise with native whey ( 0.112 % ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1–5 h after exercise with native whey than with milk ( 0.112 % vs. 0.064 , P = 0.023 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Despite higher - magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey , it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6 K during a 5-h post - exercise period . Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6 K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period .

We assessed the cost - effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis using low dose penicillin V in patients following a first episode ( 6 months prophylaxis ) and more recurrent cellulitis ( 12 months prophylaxis , or 6 months in those declining 12 months ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Within - trial cost - effectiveness analysis was conducted using the findings of two randomised placebo - controlled multicentre trials ( PATCH I and PATCH II ) , in which patients recruited in the UK and Ireland were followed - up for up to 3 years . Incremental cost , reduction in recurrence , cost per recurrence prevented and cost / QALY were estimated . National unit and reference costs for England in 2010 were applied to resource use , exploring NHS and societal perspectives . A total of 397 patients from the two trials contributed to the analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There was a 29 % reduction in the number of recurrences occurring within the trial ( IRR : 0.71 95%CI : 0.53 to 0.90 , p = 0.02 ) , corresponding to an absolute reduction of recurrence of 0.31 recurrences / patient ( 95%CI : 0.05 to 0.59 , p = 0.02 ) . Incremental costs of prophylaxis suggested a small cost saving but were not statistically significant , comparing the two groups . If a decision - maker is willing to pay up to £ 25,000 / QALY then there is a 66 % probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost - effective from an NHS perspective , rising to 76 % probability from a secondary , societal perspective . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Following first episode or recurrent cellulitis of the leg , prophylactic low dose penicillin is a very low cost intervention which , on balance , is effective and cost - effective at preventing subsequent attacks .

The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 with a noninferiority margin of − 50 mL in the per - protocol ( PP ) population . The incidence of adverse events was also assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In total , 236 patients ( mean age 64.4 years , 60 % male ) were included in the intent - to - treat population and 227 were included in the PP population . UMEC / VI treatment was noninferior in the PP population and superior in the intent - to - treat population to TIO / OLO treatment with regard to trough FEV1 at week 8 [ FEV1 change from baseline 180 mL vs 128 mL ; difference 52 mL ( 95 % confidence interval 28–77 mL ) ; p < 0.001 ] . Patients receiving UMEC / VI had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase ( 100 mL or more ) from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 compared with patients receiving TIO / OLO ( odds ratio 2.05 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.34–3.14 ) . Adverse events occurred in 25 % of patients in the UMEC / VI group and in 31 % of patients in the TIO / OLO group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : In this first direct comparison of two once - daily fixed - dose LAMA / LABA combinations , superiority was observed for the primary end point of trough FEV1 at week 8 with UMEC / VI compared with TIO / OLO in patients with symptomatic COPD . Both treatments had similar safety profiles . These findings confirm the results of previous indirect LAMA / LABA comparisons , and show that an efficacy gradient exists within the LAMA / LABA class .

182,182,4077042_3,4077042,"TITLE : Effects of Omeprazole on Sleep Disturbance : Randomized Multicenter Double - Blind Placebo - Controlled Trial ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : : Gastroesophageal reflux is considered to cause sleep disturbance , whereas proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) administration is reported to improve insomnia associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . The majority of patients with gastroesophageal reflux are asymptomatic and a significant number with erosive esophagitis are also reported to be asymptomatic . We examined whether PPI administration has a therapeutic effect for improving insomnia in patients without reflux symptoms in the same manner as patients with reflux symptoms . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : We performed a randomized multicenter double - blind placebo - controlled trial using 176 patients with insomnia regardless of the presence of reflux symptoms . The patients were divided into those administered omeprazole ( 20 mg ) or a placebo for 14 days . Four self - reporting questionnaires , QOLRAD - J ( Japanese translation of Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia ) , Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , and a sleep diary , were used for evaluating GERD - related quality of life ( QOL ) and sleep disturbance . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : We evaluated 171 patients with insomnia , of whom 69 had typical reflux symptoms . Omeprazole statistically significantly improved GERD - related QOL from 30.8±0.7 to 33.0±0.5 ( P<0.01 ) ( QOLRAD - J , total ) and from 6.0±0.2 to 6.6±0.1 ( P<0.01 ) ( QOLRAD - J , sleep - related ) when administrated to patients with reflux symptoms . Omeprazole also improved insomnia significantly better than the placebo in patients with reflux symptoms ; PSQI , from 9.3±0.5 to 7.9±0.5 ( P<0.01 ) and sleep diary , from 2.1±0.1 to 1.8±0.1 ( P<0.01 ) . On the other hand , the therapeutic effects of omeprazole and the placebo were not different in patients without reflux symptoms .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Thirty - one Catholic parishes were enrolled . Twenty were randomized to a "" capacity enhancement "" ( CE ) intervention and 11 to a "" standard dissemination "" ( SD ) condition . Each received a Program Implementation Manual and Toolkit of materials culturally adapted for FBOs with Latino audiences for five types of EBS recommended by the US Preventive Services Community Guide . CE parishes were offered a menu of capacity - building activities over a 3-month period , while SD parishes were provided a one - time consultation by an Intervention Specialist . Baseline and follow - up surveys compared the number and types of EBS offered . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At baseline , only one parish had offered any cancer - related program in the prior year , yet a third ( 36 % ) had offered some other type of health program or service . At post - intervention follow - up , all parishes offered a greater number of EBS . The only statistically significant difference between CE and SD groups was the number of parishes offering small media interventions ( 90 % in CE , 64 % in SD ; p < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : All parishes increased the number of cancer control activities offered to their members . These findings suggest that Catholic parishes may already have capacity to implement EBS if they are appropriately adapted and packaged and may only require low levels of support to carry out programming . Further research is needed to examine the extent to which program offerings continued after the period of grant funding .

161,161,4145879_3,4145879,"TITLE : Is transcranial direct current stimulation a potential method for improving response inhibition ? ABSTRACT : Inhibitory control of movement in motor learning requires the ability to suppress an inappropriate action , a skill needed to stop a planned or ongoing motor response in response to changes in a variety of environments . This study used a stop - signal task to determine whether transcranial direct - current stimulation over the pre - supplementary motor area alters the reaction time in motor inhibition . Forty healthy subjects were recruited for this study and were randomly assigned to either the transcranial direct - current stimulation condition or a sham - transcranial direct - current stimulation condition . All subjects consecutively performed the stop - signal task before , during , and after the delivery of anodal transcranial direct - current stimulation over the pre - supplementary motor area ( pre - transcranial direct - current stimulation phase , transcranial direct - current stimulation phase , and post - transcranial direct - current stimulation phase ) . Compared to the sham condition , there were significant reductions in the stop - signal processing times during and after transcranial direct - current stimulation , and change times were significantly greater in the transcranial direct - current stimulation condition . There was no significant change in go processing - times during or after transcranial direct - current stimulation in either condition . Anodal transcranial direct - current stimulation was feasibly coupled to an interactive improvement in inhibitory control . This coupling led to a decrease in the stop - signal process time required for the appropriate responses between motor execution and inhibition . However , there was no transcranial direct - current stimulation effect on the no - signal reaction time during the stop - signal task . Transcranial direct - current stimulation can adjust certain behaviors , and it could be a useful clinical intervention for patients who have difficulties with response inhibition .",scaled attention,Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition || Control || Go processing-times,"[(217, 239)]",2,dev,attention

The distant organ injury such as acute lung injury is one of the side effects of AKI or kidney IRI . In this study , we performed bilateral renal IRI in rats and the protective role of N - acetylcysteine ( NAC ) in kidney and lung was investigated . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Rats ( n = 30 ) were randomly assigned to four experiment groups . The group 1 was assigned as sham - operated group . Before kidney IRI performance , the others groups were treated with saline ( group 2 ) , 150 mg / kg ( group 3 ) or 500 mg / kg ( group 4 ) of NAC , and the treatment were continued daily after IRI for next 3 days . At day 3 , the all groups ' animals were subjected for the measurements . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The serum level of blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and creatinine ( Cr ) in the control group increased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) , and administration of NAC ( 150 mg / kg ) decreased the serum levels of Cr and BUN . However , only the serum level of Cr decreased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) .

We examined the effects of two group - based HIV prevention interventions that engaged men and their female partners together in a couples intervention ( Couples Health CoOp [ CHC ] ) and a gender - separate intervention ( Men 's Health CoOp / Women 's Health CoOp [ MHC / WHC ] ) on women 's reports of power , communication , and conflict in relationships . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The cluster - randomized field experiment included heterosexual couples from a high - density South African township in which neighborhoods were randomized to one of the intervention arms or a control arm that received the WHC only . Participants completed in - person study visits at baseline and 6-month follow - up . We examined group differences using one - way analysis of variance and multivariable regression models . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 290 couples enrolled , 255 women remained in the same partnership over 6 months . Following the intervention , women in the CHC arm compared with those in the WHC arm were more likely to report an increase in relationship control ( β=0.92 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.02 , 1.83 , P=0.045 ) and gender norms supporting female autonomy in relationships ( β=0.99 , 95 % CI : 0.07 , 1.91 , P=0.035 ) . Women in the MHC / WHC arm were more likely to report increases in relationship equity , relative to those in the CHC arm , and had a higher odds of reporting no victimization during the previous 3 months ( MHC / WHC vs WHC : odds ratio = 3.05 , 95 % CI : 1.55 , 6.0 , P=0.001 ; CHC vs MHC / WHC : odds ratio = 0.38 , 95 % CI : 0.20 , 0.74 , P=0.004 ) .

184,184,4674480_0,4674480,"TITLE : IDegLira Versus Alternative Intensification Strategies in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Basal Insulin Therapy ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : IDegLira is a once - daily combination of insulin degludec ( IDeg ) and liraglutide . Trials directly comparing IDegLira with alternative strategies for intensifying basal insulin are ongoing . While awaiting results , this analysis compared indirectly how different strategies affected glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and other outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A pooled analysis of five completed Novo Nordisk randomized clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin was used to compare indirectly IDegLira ( N = 199 ) with : addition of liraglutide to basal insulin ( N = 225 ) [ glucagon - like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1RA ) add - on strategy ] ; basal – bolus ( BB ) insulin [ insulin glargine ( IGlar ) + insulin aspart ] ( N = 56 ) ; or up - titration of IGlar ( N = 329 ) . A supplementary analysis was performed with the BB arm including patients who received IGlar or IDeg as basal insulin in the relevant trial ( N = 210 ) . All trials had comparable inclusion / exclusion criteria and baseline characteristics . Individual patient - level data were analyzed using multivariable statistical models with potential baseline heterogeneity accounted for using explanatory variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At end of study , differences between IDegLira and BB or up - titrated IGlar , respectively , were as follows : reduction in HbA1c −0.30 % , 95 % confidence interval ( – 0.58 ; −0.01 ) and −0.65 % ( −0.83 ; −0.47 ) ; change in body weight −6.89 kg ( −7.92 ; −5.86 ) and −4.04 kg ( −4.69 ; −3.40 ) all in favor of IDegLira . Confirmed hypoglycemia rate was 122.8 ( 90.7 ; 166.1 ) , 1060.8 ( 680.2 ; 1654.4 ) , and 286.1 ( 231.1 ; 354.1 ) events/100 patient - years for IDegLira , BB , and up - titrated IGlar , respectively . Odds ratios for achieving HbA1c < 7.0 % , < 7.0 % without hypoglycemia , and < 7.0 % without hypoglycemia and no weight gain were greater with IDegLira versus up - titrated IGlar . The supplementary analysis yielded similar results to the main analysis . Results with IDegLira were similar to those for the ' GLP-1RA add - on ' arm .

Nutrition may affect acid – base balance and further physical performance . With the help of PRAL ( potential renal acid load ) , a low - protein vegetarian diet ( LPVD ) was designed to enhance the production of bases in body . The aim of this study was to investigate if LPVD has an effect on blood acid – base status and performance during submaximal and maximal aerobic cycling . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Nine healthy , recreationally active men ( age 23.5 ± 3.4 yr ) participated in the study and were randomly divided into two groups in a cross - over study design . Group 1 followed LPVD for 4 days and group 2 ate normally ( ND ) before performing a cycle ergometer test . The test included three 10-min stages at 40 , 60 and 80 % of VO2max . The fourth stage was performed at 100 % of VO2max until exhaustion . After 10–16 days , the groups started a second 4-day diet , and at the end performed the similar ergometer test . Venous blood samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of both diet periods and after every stage cycled . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Diet caused no significant difference in venous blood pH , strong ion difference ( SID ) , total concentration of weak acids ( Atot ) , partial pressure of CO2 ( pCO2 ) or HCO3- at rest or during cycling between LPVD and ND . In the LPVD group , at rest SID significantly increased over the diet period ( 38.6 ± 1.8 vs. 39.8 ± 0.9 , p=0.009 ) . Diet had no significant effect on exercise time to exhaustion , but VO2 was significantly higher at 40 , 60 and 80 % of VO2max after LPVD compared to ND ( 2.03 ± 0.25 vs. 1.82 ± 0.21 l / min , p=0.035 ; 2.86 ± 0.36 vs. 2.52 ± 0.33 l / min , p<0.001 and 4.03 ± 0.50 vs. 3.54 ± 0.58 l / min , p<0.001 ; respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no difference in venous blood acid – base status between a 4-day LPVD and ND . VO2 was increased during submaximal cycling after LPVD suggesting that the exercise economy was poorer . This had no further effect on maximal aerobic performance .

However , pneumoperitoneum can pose risks to the kidneys by causing a decrease in renal blood flow . Furthermore , as in other surgical procedures , laparoscopic bariatric surgery triggers an acute inflammatory response . Neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin is an early and accurate biomarker of renal injury , as well as of the inflammatory response . Anesthetic drugs could offer some protection for the kidneys and could attenuate the acute inflammatory response from surgical trauma . The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two types of anesthetics , propofol and sevoflurane , on the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Sixty - four patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized into two anesthesia groups and were administered either total intravenous anesthesia ( propofol ) or inhalation anesthesia ( sevoflurane ) . In the perioperative period , blood samples were collected at three time points ( before anesthesia , 6 hours after pneumoperitoneum and 24 hours after pneumoperitoneum ) and urine output was measured for 24 hours . Acute kidney injuries were evaluated by examining both the clinical and laboratory parameters during the postoperative period . The differences between the groups were compared using non - parametric tests . ReBEC ( http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br / rg / recruiting/ ) : RBR-8wt2fy ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : None of the patients developed an acute kidney injury during the study and no significant differences were found between the serum neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin levels of the groups during the perioperative period .

485,485,5404432_1,5404432,"TITLE : Improving Pressure Ulcer Reconstruction : Our Protocol and the COP ( Cone of Pressure ) Flap ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Surgical treatment of pressure ulcers is challenging for high recurrence rates . Deepithelialized flaps have been used previously with the aim to eliminate shearing forces and the cone of pressure ( COP ) effect . The goal of this study is to adopt a standardized protocol and evaluate if 2 different flap techniques affect outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : The novel COP flap is illustrated . Twenty patients were prospectively treated with flap coverage over a 36-month period . According to the flap type , patients were assigned to 2 groups : group 1 with 11 patients treated with the COP flap and group 2 with 9 patients treated with conventional flap without anchoring technique . We adopted a standardized protocol of debridement , tissue cultures , and negative - pressure wound therapy . Rotation fasciocutaneous flaps were used for both groups and mean follow - up was 19 months . The COP flap is a large deepithelialized rotation flap inset with transcutaneous nonabsorbable bolster sutures . The 2 groups were comparable for demographics and ulcer location and size ( P < 0.05 ) . Five patients showed positive cultures and were treated with antibiotics and negative - pressure therapy before surgery . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Recurrence rates were 12 % in the COP flap group and 60 % in the conventional flap coverage group ( P < 0.001 ) . Results were compared at 16-month follow - up . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : The COP flap significantly reduces recurrences and eliminates shearing forces , suture ripping , and tension on superficial soft - tissue layers .

162,162,4145879_4,4145879,"TITLE : Is transcranial direct current stimulation a potential method for improving response inhibition ? ABSTRACT : Inhibitory control of movement in motor learning requires the ability to suppress an inappropriate action , a skill needed to stop a planned or ongoing motor response in response to changes in a variety of environments . This study used a stop - signal task to determine whether transcranial direct - current stimulation over the pre - supplementary motor area alters the reaction time in motor inhibition . Forty healthy subjects were recruited for this study and were randomly assigned to either the transcranial direct - current stimulation condition or a sham - transcranial direct - current stimulation condition . All subjects consecutively performed the stop - signal task before , during , and after the delivery of anodal transcranial direct - current stimulation over the pre - supplementary motor area ( pre - transcranial direct - current stimulation phase , transcranial direct - current stimulation phase , and post - transcranial direct - current stimulation phase ) . Compared to the sham condition , there were significant reductions in the stop - signal processing times during and after transcranial direct - current stimulation , and change times were significantly greater in the transcranial direct - current stimulation condition . There was no significant change in go processing - times during or after transcranial direct - current stimulation in either condition . Anodal transcranial direct - current stimulation was feasibly coupled to an interactive improvement in inhibitory control . This coupling led to a decrease in the stop - signal process time required for the appropriate responses between motor execution and inhibition . However , there was no transcranial direct - current stimulation effect on the no - signal reaction time during the stop - signal task . Transcranial direct - current stimulation can adjust certain behaviors , and it could be a useful clinical intervention for patients who have difficulties with response inhibition .",attention,Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition || Control || Go processing-times,"[(217, 239)]",1,dev,attention

This study was conducted to assess the effects of prenatal education on mothers ' stress and labor . This clinical trial was conducted to study 195 women ( 132 in the control group and 63 in the experimental group ) who had attended healthcare centers in the city of Amol after their 16th gestational week . The experimental group participated in educational classes to learn how to experience a safe childbirth for 6 - 8 sessions of 1.5 hours almost every three weeks . The control group received only a routine care , pain assessment scales like Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and McGill questionnaire , and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) were employed to collect data . The data were analyzed using SPSS software through t - test and Chi Square test to compare the groups . The results of the t - test showed a meaningful difference in levels of stress felt by the experimental group compared to control group ( p=0.002 ) . The Visual Analogue Scale suggested that in the transitional stages ( 8 - 10 cm cervical dilation ) , the level of pain felt by the experimental group was meaningfully lower than that felt by the control group ( p=0.03 ) . However , this was not significantly different between the two groups at 3 - 4 cm cervical dilation and the second stage of childbirth . The McGill scale 's results for measuring pain levels , proved a meaningful difference between the experimental group and the control group ( p=0.018 ) .

However , whether these changes persist during weight maintenance or regain remains to be determined . ABSTRACT.SUBJECTS / METHODS : Overweight or obese ( BMI : 25.8–42.5 kg / m2 ) women ( n=40 ) with at least two risk factors for the metabolic syndrome participated in this 12-mo study that examined the effects of prescribed weight loss and regain , with or without exercise , on bone turnover and on bone mineral density ( BMD ) in a subset of participants ( n=24 ) . During the first 6 mo , participants lost ~10 % of their initial body weight via energy restriction and supervised aerobic exercise . Following weight loss , participants were randomly assigned to either an exercise or a no - exercise treatment for the regain ( +50 % of weight lost ) phase . A one - way ( time ) repeated measures ANOVA tested the effects of weight loss on BMD and bone turnover , and a two - way RM ANOVA ( time , exercise ) was used to examine the effects of exercise during weight regain . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Hip ( p=0.007 ) and lumbar spine ( p=0.05 ) BMD decreased with weight loss , and remained reduced after weight regain with or without exercise . Likewise , the weight - loss - associated increases in osteocalcin ( p<0.001 ) and C - terminal peptide of type I collagen ( p<0.001 ) persisted following weight regain , independent of exercise .

These sprays have sensory attributes such as scent and/or odor , taste and aftertaste , and run down the throat and/or the nose , which , when unpleasant , can affect patient preference for , and compliance with , treatment . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : : This study examined patient preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray ( FFNS ) or mometasone furoate nasal spray ( MFNS ) based on their sensory attributes after administration in patients with allergic rhinitis . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : This was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , cross - over study . Patient preferences were determined by using three questionnaires ( Overall Preference , Immediate Attributes , and Delayed Attributes ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Overall , 56 % of patients stated a preference for FFNS versus 32 % for MFNS ( p < 0.001 ) ; the remaining 12 % stated no preference . More patients stated a preference for FFNS versus MFNS for the attributes of "" less drip down the throat "" ( p < 0.001 ) , "" less run out of the nose "" ( p < 0.05 ) , "" more soothing "" ( p < 0.05 ) , and "" less irritating "" ( p < 0.001 ) .

The hand - on - syringe ( HS ) needle technique is ideally suited to the emergency department setting because it allows a single operator to perform the block without assistance . The HS technique is assumed to provide less exact needle control than the alternative two - operator hand - on - needle ( HN ) technique ; however this assumption has never been directly tested . The primary objective of this study was to compare accuracy of needle targeting under ultrasound guidance by emergency medicine ( EM ) residents using HN and HS techniques on a standardized gelatinous simulation model . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This prospective , randomized study evaluated task performance . We compared needle targeting accuracy using the HN and HS techniques . Each participant performed a set of structured needling maneuvers ( both simple and difficult ) on a standardized partial - task simulator . We evaluated time to task completion , needle visualization during advancement , and accuracy of needle tip at targeting . Resident technique preference was assessed using a post - task survey . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We evaluated 60 tasks performed by 10 EM residents . There was no significant difference in time to complete the simple model ( HN vs. HS , 18 seconds vs. 18 seconds , p=0.93 ) , time to complete the difficult model ( HN vs. HS , 56 seconds vs. 50 seconds , p=0.63 ) , needle visualization , or needle tip targeting accuracy . Most residents ( 60 % ) preferred the HS technique . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : For EM residents learning UGNBs , the HN technique was not associated with superior needle control . Our results suggest that the single - operator HS technique provides equivalent needle control when compared to the two - operator HN technique .",attention,single operator hand-on-syringe (HS) needle technique || two-operator hand-on-needle (HN) technique || residents preference,"[(293, 304)]",1,dev,scaled attention

We assessed the cost - effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis using low dose penicillin V in patients following a first episode ( 6 months prophylaxis ) and more recurrent cellulitis ( 12 months prophylaxis , or 6 months in those declining 12 months ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Within - trial cost - effectiveness analysis was conducted using the findings of two randomised placebo - controlled multicentre trials ( PATCH I and PATCH II ) , in which patients recruited in the UK and Ireland were followed - up for up to 3 years . Incremental cost , reduction in recurrence , cost per recurrence prevented and cost / QALY were estimated . National unit and reference costs for England in 2010 were applied to resource use , exploring NHS and societal perspectives . A total of 397 patients from the two trials contributed to the analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There was a 29 % reduction in the number of recurrences occurring within the trial ( IRR : 0.71 95%CI : 0.53 to 0.90 , p = 0.02 ) , corresponding to an absolute reduction of recurrence of 0.31 recurrences / patient ( 95%CI : 0.05 to 0.59 , p = 0.02 ) . Incremental costs of prophylaxis suggested a small cost saving but were not statistically significant , comparing the two groups . If a decision - maker is willing to pay up to £ 25,000 / QALY then there is a 66 % probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost - effective from an NHS perspective , rising to 76 % probability from a secondary , societal perspective . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Following first episode or recurrent cellulitis of the leg , prophylactic low dose penicillin is a very low cost intervention which , on balance , is effective and cost - effective at preventing subsequent attacks .

In rural Africa , most children with diarrhea are not brought to health facilities . In a village - randomized trial in rural Kenya , we assessed if zinc treatment might have a community - level preventive effect on diarrhea incidence if available at home versus only at health facilities . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We randomized 16 Kenyan villages ( 1,903 eligible children ) to receive a 10-day course of zinc and two oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) sachets every two months at home and 17 villages ( 2,241 eligible children ) to receive ORS at home , but zinc at the health – facility only . Children 's caretakers were educated in zinc / ORS use by village workers , both unblinded to intervention arm . We evaluated whether incidence of diarrhea and acute lower respiratory illness ( ALRI ) reported at biweekly home visits and presenting to clinic were lower in zinc villages , using poisson regression adjusting for baseline disease rates , distance to clinic , and children 's age . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There were no differences between village groups in diarrhea incidence either reported at the home or presenting to clinic . In zinc villages ( 1,440 children analyzed ) , 61.2 % of diarrheal episodes were treated with zinc , compared to 5.4 % in comparison villages ( 1,584 children analyzed , p<0.0001 ) . There were no differences in ORS use between zinc ( 59.6 % ) and comparison villages ( 58.8 % ) . Among children with fever or cough without diarrhea , zinc use was low ( < 0.5 % ) . There was a lower incidence of reported ALRI in zinc villages ( adjusted RR 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.46–0.99 ) , but not presenting at clinic . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In this study , home zinc use to treat diarrhea did not decrease disease rates in the community .

The possibility of accomplishing PLF using a mixture of porous β - CPP and iliac bone was studied . This paper reports the radiologic results of PLF using the β - CPP plus autograft for lumbar degenerative disease as a bone graft extender . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , case - matched , radiographic study evaluating the results of short segment lumbar fusion using a β - CPP plus autograft was performed to compare the efficacy of β - CPP plus autograft with that of an autograft alone for short segment lumbar fusion . Thirty one consecutive patients ( 46 levels ) underwent posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw fixation and additional posterior lumbar interbody fusion . In all patients , 3 mL of β - CPP plus 3 mL of autogenous bone graft was placed randomly in one side of a posterolateral gutter , and 6 mL of autogenous iliac bone graft was placed on the other . The fusion rates , volumes of fusion masses , and bone absorption percentage were evaluated postoperatively using simple radiographs and 3 dimensional computed tomography ( 3D - CT ) scans . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The control sides treated with an autograft showed significantly better Lenke scores than the study sides treated with β - CPP at 3 and 6 months postoperatively , but there was no difference between the two sides at 12 months . The fusion rates ( confirmed by 3D - CT ) were 87.0 % in the β - CPP group and 89.1 % in the autograft group , which were not significantly different . The fusion mass volumes and bone absorption percentage at 12 months postoperatively were 2.49 mL ( 58.4 % ) and 1.89 mL ( 69.5 % ) for the β - CPP and autograft groups , respectively , and mean fusion mass volume was significantly higher in the β - CPP group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : β - CPP combined with an autograft is as effective as autologous bone for grafting during instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion . These findings suggest that β - CPP bone chips can be used as a novel bone graft extender for short - segment posterolateral spinal fusion .",others,Porous β-calcium pyrophosphate (β-CPP) plus autograft || Autograft alone || Fusion rates,"[(281, 314)]",0,dev,scaled attention

Therefore , it is relevant and necessary to systematically manipulate website characteristics to test their effect on website use . This study focuses on user control as a website characteristic . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To test whether and how user control ( the freedom of choice to skip pages ) can increase website use and knowledge gained from the website . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants older than 18 years were drawn from the Dutch Internet population ( in June 2011 ) and completed a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire . Subsequently , they were randomly assigned to three groups : ( 1 ) a tunneled version of the website with less user control ; ( 2 ) a high user control version of the website where visitors had the freedom of choice to skip pages ; and ( 3 ) a control group that was not exposed to the website . Participants completed ( 1 ) a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website ( except for the control group ) , and ( 2 ) a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire after one week to test whether participants in the experimental groups only clicked through the website or actually processed and learned its content . Server registrations were used to assess website use . Analyses of covariance ( ANCOVA ) using all available data were conducted to determine whether user control increases website use . Structural equation models ( SEM ) using all available data were constructed to test how user control increases website use — a latent variable derived from number of pages visited and time on website . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 1044 persons invited to participate , 668 took part ( 668/1044 , 64.0 % ) . One half of participants ( 332/668 49.7 % ) were female and the mean age was 49 years ( SD 16 ) . A total of 571 participants completed the one - week follow - up measure regarding hepatitis knowledge ( 571/668 , 85.5 % ) . The findings demonstrate that having less user control ( ie , a tunneled version of the website ) had a negative effect on users ' perception of efficiency ( F1,452 = 97.69 , P < .001 ) , but a positive effect on number of pages visited ( F1,452 = 171.49 , P < .001 ) , time on the website ( F1,452 = 6.32 , P = .01 ) , and knowledge gained from the website ( F1,452 = 134.32 , P < .001 ) . The direct effect of having less user control appeared to surpass the effect mediated by efficiency , because website use was higher among participants exposed to the tunneled version of the website in comparison with those having the freedom of choice to skip pages . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The key finding that visitors demonstrated increased website use in the tunneled version of the website indicates that visitors should be carefully guided through the intervention for future intervention websites .",attention,High user control || Low user control || Perception of efficiency,"[(398, 436)]",1,dev,ig

Inhibition of L - type calcium channels or HMG - CoA pathway improves endothelial function and reduces plaque size . Thus , we investigated in stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) the effects of a calcium antagonist on coronary endothelial function and plaque size . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS : In 454 patients undergoing PCI , acetylcholine ( 10−6 to 10−4 M ) was infused in a coronary segment without significant CAD . Changes in coronary diameter were measured and an intravascular ultrasound examination ( IVUS ) was performed . On top of statin therapy , patients were randomized in a double - blind fashion to placebo or nifedipine GITS 30–60 mg / day and followed for 18–24 months . Blood pressure was lower on nifedipine than on placebo by 5.8/2.1 mmHg ( P < 0.001 ) as was total and LDL cholesterol ( 4.8 mg / dL ; P = 0.495 ) , while HDL was higher ( 3.6 mg / dL ; P = 0.026 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twelve adult male ( 27.3 ± 1.0 yr , 178.6 ± 1.4 cm , 78.0 ± 2.5 kg , 8.9 ± 1.1 % fat ) endurance - trained ( 53.3 ± 2.0 ml * kg-1 * min-1 , cycling ~160 km / wk ) cyclists completed a simulated road race on a cycle ergometer ( Lode ) , consisting of a two - hour cycling bout at 60 % of peak aerobic capacity ( VO2peak ) with three 10-second sprints performed at 110 % VO2 peak every 15 minutes . Cyclists completed the 2-hr cycling bout before and after dietary creatine monohydrate or placebo supplementation ( 3 g / day for 28 days ) . Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and five minutes before the end of the two - hour ride . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There was a 24.5 ± 10.0 % increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 ± 23.9 % increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group ( P < 0.05 ) . Plasma glucose , blood lactate , and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride , as well as VO2 peak , were not affected by creatine supplementation . Submaximal oxygen consumption near the end of the two - hour ride was decreased by approximately 10 % by creatine supplementation ( P < 0.05 ) . Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post - supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group ( +14.0 ± 6.3 % ) than the placebo group ( -10.4 ± 4.4 % ; P < 0.05 ) at 90 minutes of exercise . The time of the final sprint to exhaustion at the end of the 2-hour cycling bout was not affected by creatine supplementation ( creatine pre , 64.4 ± 13.5s ; creatine post , 88.8 ± 24.6s ; placebo pre , 69.0 ± 24.8s ; placebo post 92.8 ± 31.2s : creatine vs. placebo not significant ) . Power output for the final sprint was increased by ~33 % in both groups ( creatine vs. placebo not significant ) .

Because of the practical difficulties encountered in improving the nutritional adequacy of traditional complementary foods and the limitations associated with the use of liquid iron supplementation for the treatment and prevention of IDA in infants and young children , recently , home - fortification with multivitamins and minerals sprinkles was recommended . This study aims to compare the effect of twice weekly versus daily supplementation with multivitamins and minerals powder ( MMP ) on anaemia prevalence , haemoglobin concentration , and growth in infants and young children in a rural community in Lao PDR . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A randomized trial was conducted in six rural communities . Children aged 6 to 52 months ( n = 336 ) were randomly assigned to a control group ( n = 110 ) or to one of two intervention groups receiving either two sachets per week ( n = 115 ) or a daily sachet ( n = 111 ) of MMP for 24 weeks ; 331 children completed the study . A finger prick of blood was taken at baseline , at week 12 , and again at week 24 to determine haemoglobin concentration . Anthropometric measurements were taken every 4 weeks . The McNemar test was used to assess within group differences at three time points in the study subjects with anaemia and one - way ANOVA was used to assess changes in mean haemoglobin concentration in the treatment groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : MMP supplementation resulted in significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration and in the reduction of anaemia prevalence in the two treatment groups compared with the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . The severely to moderately anaemic children ( Hb < 100 g / L ) on daily supplementation recovered faster than those on twice weekly supplementation . MMP was well accepted and compliance was high in both treatment groups . Overall , the improvement in the weight for age Z - score was very small and not statistically significant across the three study groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : MMP supplementation had positive effects in reduction of anaemia prevalence and in improving haemoglobin concentration . For severely to moderately anaemic children , daily MMP supplementation was more effective in improving haemoglobin concentration and reducing anaemia prevalence .

401,401,3790030_3,3790030,"TITLE : Dexmedetomidine for sedation of patients undergoing elective surgery under regional anesthesia ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Dexmedetomidine may be useful as a sedative agent . However , it has been reported that dexmedetomidine decreases systemic blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output in a dose - dependent manner . The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine for sedation . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty - five American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I - II patients under spinal anesthesia received dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg intravenously as a loading dose . The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups for maintenance dose : Group A ( 0.25 μg / kg / hr ) , Group B ( 0.50 μg / kg / hr ) , and Group C ( 0.75 μg / kg / hr ) . The hemodynamic variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) score were recorded for all patients . The numbers of patients who developed hypotension , bradycardia , or inadequate sedation necessitating further drug treatment were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and SpO2 were decreased , and RSS score was increased significantly at both 20 min and 40 min after injection of dexmedetomidine in the three study groups compared to baseline , without significant differences between the groups . The prevalence of hypotension , but not that of bradycardia or adjunctive midazolam administration , exhibited a positive correlation with the dose of dexmedetomidine . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg followed by continuous administration at infusion rates of 0.25 , 0.50 , or 0.75 μg / kg / hr produced adequate levels of sedation . However , there was a tendency for the incidence of hypotension to increase as the dose increased . To minimize the risk of hemodynamic instability , a dose of 0.25 μg / kg / hr may be the most appropriate for continuous administration of dexmedetomidine .",attention,Dexmedetomidine 0.25 μg/kg/hr || Dexmedetomidine 0.50 μg/kg/hr || Systolic blood pressure,"[(187, 231)]",1,dev,deeplift

706,706,5697397_4,5697397,"TITLE : Native whey protein with high levels of leucine results in similar post - exercise muscular anabolic responses as regular whey protein : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Protein intake is essential to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis , and the amino acid leucine seems to possess a superior effect on muscle protein synthesis compared to other amino acids . Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey ( WPC-80 ) . This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2 × 20 g of native whey protein , WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind , randomized , partial crossover , controlled study . Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey ( n = 10 ) , in a crossover design , or milk ( n = 12 ) . Supplements were ingested immediately ( 20 g ) and two hours after ( 20 g ) a bout of heavy - load lower body resistance exercise . Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas - chromatography mass spectrometry , muscle phosphorylation of p70S6 K , 4E – BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting , and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [ 2H5]phenylalanine - infusion , gas - chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope - ratio mass spectrometry . Being the main comparison , differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one - way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two - way ANOVA . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk ( P < 0.05 ) . Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6 K than milk 180 min after exercise ( P = 0.03 ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1–3 h hours after exercise with WPC-80 ( 0.119 % ) , and 1–5 h after exercise with native whey ( 0.112 % ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1–5 h after exercise with native whey than with milk ( 0.112 % vs. 0.064 , P = 0.023 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Despite higher - magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey , it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6 K during a 5-h post - exercise period . Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6 K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period .

The dietary treatments were mulberry leaf pellet ( MUP ) supplementation at 0 , 200 , 400 and 600 g / hd / d with rice straw fed to allow ad libitum intake . All steers were kept in individual pens and supplemented with concentrate at 5 g / kg of body weight daily . The experiment was 4 periods , and each lasted 21 d. During the first 14 d , all steers were fed their respective diets ad libitum and during the last 7 d , they were moved to metabolism crates for total urine and fecal collection . It was found that increasing MUP levels resulted in linearly increasing rice straw and total intakes ( p<0.05 ) . Ruminal temperature and pH were not significantly affected by MUP supplementation while NH3-N concentration was increased ( p<0.05 ) and maintained at a high level ( 18.5 mg / dl ) with supplementation of MUP at 600 g / hd / d . Similarly , viable total bacteria in the rumen and cellulolytic bacteria were enriched by MUP supplementation at 600 g / hd / d . However , the rumen microbial diversity determined with a PCR - DGGE technique showed similar methanogenic diversity between treatments and sampling times and were similar at a 69 % genetic relationship as determined by a UPGMA method . Based on this study , it could be concluded that supplementation of MUP at 600 g / hd / d improved DM intake , ruminal NH3-N , and cellulolytic bacteria thus iimproving rumen ecology in beef cattle fed with rice straw .",attention,Mulberry leaf pellet at 600 g/hd/d || Mulberry leaf pellet at 200 g/hd/d || Ruminal temperature,"[(167, 178)]",1,dev,gradients

Its efficacy in providing analgesia for SIL cholecystectomy ( SILC ) via the same approach remains unexplored . ABSTRACT.AIMS : : The primary objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral TAP block with local anesthetic infiltration for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing SILC . ABSTRACT.SETTINGS AND DESIGN : : This was a prospective , randomized , controlled , double - blinded trial performed in a tertiary care hospital . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : Forty - two patients undergoing SILC were randomized to receive either ultrasound - guided ( USG ) bilateral mid - axillary TAP blocks with 0.375 % ropivacaine or local anesthetic infiltration of the port site . The primary outcome measure was the requirement of morphine in the first 24 h postoperatively . ABSTRACT.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : : The data were analyzed using t - test , Mann – Whitney test or Chi - square test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The 24 h morphine requirement ( mean ± standard deviation ) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in local infiltration group ( P = 0.688 ) . The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in TAP group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 ( P = 0.028 ) . The visual analog scale scores at rest and on coughing were significantly higher in the local infiltration group in the immediate postoperative period ( P = 0.034 and P = 0.007 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : USG bilateral TAP blocks were not effective in decreasing 24 h morphine requirement as compared to local anesthetic infiltration in patients undergoing SILC although it provided some analgesic benefit intraoperatively and in the initial 4 h postoperatively . Hence , the benefits of TAP blocks are not worth the effort and time spent for administering them for this surgery .",attention,Transversus abdominis plane block with 0.375% ropivacaine || local anesthetic infiltration of the port site. || The 24 h morphine requirement,"[(220, 254)]",1,dev,scaled attention

This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study — a phase III , randomized , open - label , controlled study ( N = 676)—to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin , a LMWH , versus vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) for prevention of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 60 ml / min ) . Overall , 162/676 ( 24 % ) patients had renal impairment at baseline . Patients received subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU / kg once daily during month 1 , followed by 150 IU / kg once daily for months 2–6 ; or VKA once daily for 6 months , with initial overlapping subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU / kg once daily for ≥5 days until international normalized ratio was 2.0–3.0 for 2 consecutive days . Endpoints included the rates of rVTE ( primary ) and bleeding events . Overall , fewer dalteparin - treated patients ( 2/74 [ 2.7 % ] ) experienced ≥1 adjudicated symptomatic rVTE compared with VKA - treated patients ( 15/88 [ 17.0 % ] ; hazard ratio = 0.15 [ 95 % confidence interval 0.03–0.65 ] ; p = 0.01 ) . Bleeding event rates for both treatments were similar ( p = 0.47 ) . In summary , compared with VKA , dalteparin significantly reduced risk of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( p = 0.01 ) while exhibiting a comparable safety profile . This analysis supports dosing patients with renal impairment in accordance with patients with normal renal function ; however , anti - Xa monitoring could be considered to further support safety in selected patients , particularly those with very severe renal impairment .",attention,Dalteparin || Vitamin K antagonist || ≥1 adjudicated symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism,"[(236, 283)]",1,dev,lime

However , pneumoperitoneum can pose risks to the kidneys by causing a decrease in renal blood flow . Furthermore , as in other surgical procedures , laparoscopic bariatric surgery triggers an acute inflammatory response . Neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin is an early and accurate biomarker of renal injury , as well as of the inflammatory response . Anesthetic drugs could offer some protection for the kidneys and could attenuate the acute inflammatory response from surgical trauma . The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two types of anesthetics , propofol and sevoflurane , on the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Sixty - four patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized into two anesthesia groups and were administered either total intravenous anesthesia ( propofol ) or inhalation anesthesia ( sevoflurane ) . In the perioperative period , blood samples were collected at three time points ( before anesthesia , 6 hours after pneumoperitoneum and 24 hours after pneumoperitoneum ) and urine output was measured for 24 hours .

Trials directly comparing IDegLira with alternative strategies for intensifying basal insulin are ongoing . While awaiting results , this analysis compared indirectly how different strategies affected glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and other outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A pooled analysis of five completed Novo Nordisk randomized clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin was used to compare indirectly IDegLira ( N = 199 ) with : addition of liraglutide to basal insulin ( N = 225 ) [ glucagon - like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1RA ) add - on strategy ] ; basal – bolus ( BB ) insulin [ insulin glargine ( IGlar ) + insulin aspart ] ( N = 56 ) ; or up - titration of IGlar ( N = 329 ) . A supplementary analysis was performed with the BB arm including patients who received IGlar or IDeg as basal insulin in the relevant trial ( N = 210 ) . All trials had comparable inclusion / exclusion criteria and baseline characteristics . Individual patient - level data were analyzed using multivariable statistical models with potential baseline heterogeneity accounted for using explanatory variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At end of study , differences between IDegLira and BB or up - titrated IGlar , respectively , were as follows : reduction in HbA1c −0.30 % , 95 % confidence interval ( – 0.58 ; −0.01 ) and −0.65 % ( −0.83 ; −0.47 ) ; change in body weight −6.89 kg ( −7.92 ; −5.86 ) and −4.04 kg ( −4.69 ; −3.40 ) all in favor of IDegLira . Confirmed hypoglycemia rate was 122.8 ( 90.7 ; 166.1 ) , 1060.8 ( 680.2 ; 1654.4 ) , and 286.1 ( 231.1 ; 354.1 ) events/100 patient - years for IDegLira , BB , and up - titrated IGlar , respectively . Odds ratios for achieving HbA1c < 7.0 % , < 7.0 % without hypoglycemia , and < 7.0 % without hypoglycemia and no weight gain were greater with IDegLira versus up - titrated IGlar . The supplementary analysis yielded similar results to the main analysis . Results with IDegLira were similar to those for the ' GLP-1RA add - on ' arm . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : These results suggest that IDegLira may be more effective , with lower hypoglycemia rates and less weight gain , than up - titrated basal insulin or BB in patients uncontrolled on basal insulin .

Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response ( RVR ) for sustained virological response ( SVR ) , we conducted an open - label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon / ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : Treatment - naive , non - cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon α-2a ( 180 μg / week ) and ribavirin ( 800–1,200 mg , according to weight ) for 4 weeks . Patients who achieved an RVR , which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 ( < 50 IU ) , were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment ( 24- and 48-week treatment groups , respectively ) . The primary outcome measure was SVR . From January 2011 to June 2014 , 152(152/210 , 72.4 % ) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group . The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention - to - treat analysis were 90.8 % ( 69/76 ) and 88.2 % ( 67/76 ) , respectively ; those in the per - protocol analysis were 95.7 % ( 67/70 ) and 97.0 % ( 64/66 ) , respectively . More patients in the 48-week group had anemia ( 46.1 % vs. 28.9 % , P = 0.03 ) , but other adverse events were comparable between the groups . The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Twenty - four weeks of peginterferon / ribavirin combination therapy was non - inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - nine colicky infants ( age 10–60 days ) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Lactobacillus reuteri ( 108 cfu ) or a placebo once daily for 21 days . Responders were defined as subjects with a decrease of 50 % in daily crying time at day 21 compared with the starting point . The microbiota of faecal samples from day 1 and 21 were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing . The primers : Bakt_341F and Bakt_805R , complemented with 454 adapters and sample specific barcodes were used for PCR amplification of the 16 S rRNA genes . The structure of the data was explored by using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and effects of different variables were visualized with ordination analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The infants ' faecal microbiota were composed of Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes as the four main phyla . The composition of the microbiota in infants with colic had very high inter - individual variability with Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratios varying from 4000 to 0.025 . On an individual basis , the microbiota was , however , relatively stable over time . Treatment with L. reuteri DSM 17938 did not change the global composition of the microbiota , but when comparing responders with non - responders the group responders had an increased relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and genus Bacteroides at day 21 compared with day 0 . Furthermore , the phyla composition of the infants at day 21 could be divided into three enterotype groups , dominated by Firmicutes , Bacteroidetes , and Actinobacteria , respectively . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : L. reuteri DSM 17938 did not affect the global composition of the microbiota . However , the increase of Bacteroidetes in the responder infants indicated that a decrease in colicky symptoms was linked to changes of the microbiota .

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NC ) for breast cancer provides a unique setting to evaluate intervention effects . Treatments leading to decreased post - neoadjuvant Ki-67 levels , smaller tumor size , and higher pathologic response are associated with improved survival and lower recurrence . This randomized , prospective pilot trial evaluates the feasibility of supervised exercise during NC for breast cancer . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Stage II - III , ER positive , cancer patients with BMI > 25 receiving NC were randomized to standard NC with supervised bootcamp ( NC + BC ) or NC alone . Ki-67 , C - peptide , BMI , and tumor size were measured before chemotherapy and at time of surgery . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There were no initial differences between groups in regards to tumor size , C - peptide , BMI , and Ki–67 . The NC + BC ( n = 5 ) group had a lower mean BMI at the conclusion of NC compared with those ( n = 5 ) in the NC group ( 28.0 versus 35.8 , P = 0.03 ) . Final tumor size was 2.59 cm in the NC + BC group versus 3.16 cm for NC ( P = 0.76 ) Mean Ki-67 for NC + BC was 7 % versus 29 % with NC ( P = 0.14 ) .

The current marketed rifaximin formulation contains polymorph alpha , the systemic bioavailability of which is very limited . This study compared the pharmacokinetics of this formulation with those of the amorphous form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Amorphous rifaximin was specifically prepared for the study and formulated as the marketed product . Two doses ( 200 mg and 400 mg ) of both formulations were given to two groups of 12 healthy volunteers of either sex according to a single - blind , randomized , two - treatment , single - dose , two - period , cross - over design . Plasma and urine samples were collected at preset times ( for 24 hours or 48 hours , respectively ) after dosing , and assayed for rifaximin concentrations by high - performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : For both dose levels , peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and cumulative urinary excretion were significantly higher after administration of amorphous rifaximin than rifaximin - α . Ninety percent confidence intervals for peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and urinary excretion ratios were largely outside the upper limit of the accepted ( 0.80–1.25 ) range , indicating higher systemic bioavailability of the amorphous rifaximin . The few adverse events recorded were not serious and not related to the study medications . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Rifaximin - α , a crystal polymorph , does differ from the amorphous form , the latter being systemically more bioavailable . In this regard , care must be taken when using – as a medicinal product – a formulation containing even small amounts of amorphous form , which may alter the peculiar pharmacologic properties of this poorly absorbed antibiotic .",scaled attention,Polymorph alpha rifaximin 400 mg || Amorphous rifaximin 400 mg || Area under curve 0-t,"[(190, 223)]",2,dev,scaled attention

Little is known about effective interventions and strategies for improving the eHealth literacy of the older population . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a theory - driven eHealth literacy intervention for older adults . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The experimental design was a 2 × 2 mixed factorial design with learning method ( collaborative ; individualistic ) as the between - participants variable and time of measurement ( pre ; post ) as the within - participants variable . A total of 146 older adults aged 56–91 ( mean 69.99 , SD 8.12 ) participated in this study during February to May 2011 . The intervention involved 2 weeks of learning about using the National Institutes of Health 's SeniorHealth.gov website to access reliable health information . The intervention took place at public libraries . Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental condition ( collaborative : n = 72 ; individualistic : n = 74 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Overall , participants ' knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy all improved significantly from pre to post intervention ( P < .001 in all cases ; effect sizes were > 0.8 with statistical power of 1.00 even at the .01 level in all cases ) . When controlling for baseline differences , no significant main effect of the learning method was found on computer / Web knowledge , skills , or eHealth literacy efficacy . Thus , collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes . No significant interaction effect of learning method and time of measurement was found . Group composition based on gender , familiarity with peers , or prior computer experience had no significant main or interaction effect on the learning outcomes . Regardless of the specific learning method used , participants had overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward the intervention and reported positive changes in participation in their own health care as a result of the intervention . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The findings provide strong evidence that the eHealth literacy intervention tested in this study , regardless of the specific learning method used , significantly improved knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy from pre to post intervention , was positively perceived by participants , and led to positive changes in their own health care . Collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes , suggesting the previously widely reported advantages of collaborative over individualistic learning may not be easily applied to the older population in informal settings , though several confounding factors might have contributed to this finding ( ie , the largely inexperienced computer user composition of the study sample , potential instructor effect , and ceiling effect ) .

67,67,4825255_7,4825255,"TITLE : The Effect of Perinatal Education on Iranian Mothers ’ Stress and Labor Pain ABSTRACT : Lack of sufficient knowledge about the unknowns of pregnancy increases stress and requires more medical interventions . This study was conducted to assess the effects of prenatal education on mothers ' stress and labor . This clinical trial was conducted to study 195 women ( 132 in the control group and 63 in the experimental group ) who had attended healthcare centers in the city of Amol after their 16th gestational week . The experimental group participated in educational classes to learn how to experience a safe childbirth for 6 - 8 sessions of 1.5 hours almost every three weeks . The control group received only a routine care , pain assessment scales like Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and McGill questionnaire , and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) were employed to collect data . The data were analyzed using SPSS software through t - test and Chi Square test to compare the groups . The results of the t - test showed a meaningful difference in levels of stress felt by the experimental group compared to control group ( p=0.002 ) . The Visual Analogue Scale suggested that in the transitional stages ( 8 - 10 cm cervical dilation ) , the level of pain felt by the experimental group was meaningfully lower than that felt by the control group ( p=0.03 ) . However , this was not significantly different between the two groups at 3 - 4 cm cervical dilation and the second stage of childbirth . The McGill scale 's results for measuring pain levels , proved a meaningful difference between the experimental group and the control group ( p=0.018 ) . Educational and supportive interventions increased mothers ' knowledge during pregnancy and reduced their fear of unknown environment and people . These trained women learned how to effectively overcome their problems and labor pain .",scaled attention,Prenatal education || Control || VAS pain during 8-10 cm dilatation,"[(204, 246)]",2,dev,scaled attention

The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of HFCWO early in the treatment of adults hospitalized for acute asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Randomized , multi - center , double - masked phase II clinical trial of active or sham treatment initiated within 24 hours of hospital admission for acute asthma or COPD at four academic medical centers . Patients received active or sham treatment for 15 minutes three times a day for four treatments . Medical management was standardized across groups . The primary outcomes were patient adherence to therapy after four treatments ( minutes used/60 minutes prescribed ) and satisfaction . Secondary outcomes included change in Borg dyspnea score ( ≥ 1 unit indicates a clinically significant change ) , spontaneously expectorated sputum volume , and forced expired volume in 1 second . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Fifty - two participants were randomized to active ( n = 25 ) or sham ( n = 27 ) treatment . Patient adherence was similarly high in both groups ( 91 % vs. 93 % ; p = 0.70 ) . Patient satisfaction was also similarly high in both groups . After four treatments , a higher proportion of patients in the active treatment group had a clinically significant improvement in dyspnea ( 70.8 % vs. 42.3 % , p = 0.04 ) . There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : HFCWO is well tolerated in adults hospitalized for acute asthma or COPD and significantly improves dyspnea . The high levels of patient satisfaction in both treatment groups justify the need for sham controls when evaluating the use of HFCWO on patient - reported outcomes . Additional studies are needed to more fully evaluate the role of HFCWO in improving in - hospital and post - discharge outcomes in this population .

It has been suggested that the loss of the prophylactic effect of presumptive - administered ACT in children who do not have malaria will result in increase in their risk of malaria and anaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : We undertook a cluster - randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of the presumptive approach using clinical judgment ( CJ - arm ) and the test - based approach using RDTs ( RDT - arm in a high - transmission setting in Ghana . A total of 3046 eligible children ( 1527 in the RDT arm and 1519 in the CJ- arm ) living around 32 health centres were enrolled . Nearly half were female ( 48.7 % ) and 47.8 % were below the age of 12 months as at enrolment . Over 24-months , the incidence of all episodes of malaria following the first febrile illness was 0.64 ( 95 % CI 0.49–0.82 ) and 0.76 ( 0.63–0.93 ) per child per year in the RDT and CJ arms respectively ( adjusted rate ratio 1.13 ( 0.82–1.55 ) . After the first episode of febrile illness , the incidence of severe anaemia was the same in both arms ( 0.11 per child per year ) and that of moderate anaemia was 0.16 ( 0.13–0.21 ) vs. 0.17 ( 0.14–0.21 ) per child year respectively . The incidence of severe febrile illness was 0.15 ( 0.09 , 0.24 ) in the RDT arm compared to 0.17 ( 0.11 , 0.28 ) per child per year respectively . The proportion of fever cases receiving ACT was lower in the RDT arm ( 72 % vs 81 % ; p = 0.02 ) .

210,210,3925077_1,3925077,"TITLE : Prophylactic Antibiotics to Prevent Cellulitis of the Leg : Economic Analysis of the PATCH I & II Trials ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Cellulitis ( erysipelas ) is a recurring and debilitating bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue . We assessed the cost - effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis using low dose penicillin V in patients following a first episode ( 6 months prophylaxis ) and more recurrent cellulitis ( 12 months prophylaxis , or 6 months in those declining 12 months ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Within - trial cost - effectiveness analysis was conducted using the findings of two randomised placebo - controlled multicentre trials ( PATCH I and PATCH II ) , in which patients recruited in the UK and Ireland were followed - up for up to 3 years . Incremental cost , reduction in recurrence , cost per recurrence prevented and cost / QALY were estimated . National unit and reference costs for England in 2010 were applied to resource use , exploring NHS and societal perspectives . A total of 397 patients from the two trials contributed to the analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There was a 29 % reduction in the number of recurrences occurring within the trial ( IRR : 0.71 95%CI : 0.53 to 0.90 , p = 0.02 ) , corresponding to an absolute reduction of recurrence of 0.31 recurrences / patient ( 95%CI : 0.05 to 0.59 , p = 0.02 ) . Incremental costs of prophylaxis suggested a small cost saving but were not statistically significant , comparing the two groups . If a decision - maker is willing to pay up to £ 25,000 / QALY then there is a 66 % probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost - effective from an NHS perspective , rising to 76 % probability from a secondary , societal perspective . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Following first episode or recurrent cellulitis of the leg , prophylactic low dose penicillin is a very low cost intervention which , on balance , is effective and cost - effective at preventing subsequent attacks . Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces cellulitis recurrence by nearly a third but is not associated with a significant increase in costs .",attention,low dose penicillin V || placebo || Cost of Prophylactic Antibiotics to Prevent Cellulitis of the Leg,"[(249, 269)]",1,dev,scaled attention

656,656,4779585_1,4779585,"TITLE : Protein intake ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Training camps for top - class endurance athletes place high physiological demands on the body . Focus on optimizing recovery between training sessions is necessary to minimize the risk of injuries and improve adaptations to the training stimuli . Carbohydrate supplementation during sessions is generally accepted as being beneficial to aid performance and recovery , whereas the effect of protein supplementation and timing is less well understood . We studied the effects of protein ingestion during training sessions on performance and recovery of elite cyclists during a strenuous training camp . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blinded study , 18 elite cyclists consumed either a whey protein hydrolysate - carbohydrate beverage ( PRO - CHO , 14 g protein / h and 69 g CHO / h ) or an isocaloric carbohydrate beverage ( CHO , 84 g / h ) during each training session for six days ( 25–29 h cycling in total ) . Diet and training were standardized and supervised . The diet was energy balanced and contained 1.7 g protein / kg / day . A 10-s peak power test and a 5-min all - out performance test were conducted before and after the first training session and repeated at day 6 of the camp . Blood and saliva samples were collected in the morning after overnight fasting during the week and analyzed for biochemical markers of muscle damage , stress , and immune function . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In both groups , 5-min all - out performance was reduced after the first training session and at day 6 compared to before the first training session , with no difference between groups . Peak power in the sprint test did not change significantly between tests or between groups . In addition , changes in markers for muscle damage , stress , and immune function were not significantly influenced by treatment . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intake of protein combined with carbohydrate during cycling at a training camp for top cyclists did not result in marked performance benefits compared to intake of carbohydrates when a recovery drink containing adequate protein and carbohydrate was ingested immediately after each training session in both groups . These findings suggest that the addition of protein to a carbohydrate supplement consumed during exercise does not improve recovery or performance in elite cyclists despite high demands of daily exhaustive sessions during a one - week training camp .",others,Whey protein hydrolysate-carbohydrate beverage || Isocaloric carbohydrate beverage || Muscle damage,"[(301, 323)]",0,dev,scaled attention

Little is known about effective interventions and strategies for improving the eHealth literacy of the older population . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a theory - driven eHealth literacy intervention for older adults . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The experimental design was a 2 × 2 mixed factorial design with learning method ( collaborative ; individualistic ) as the between - participants variable and time of measurement ( pre ; post ) as the within - participants variable . A total of 146 older adults aged 56–91 ( mean 69.99 , SD 8.12 ) participated in this study during February to May 2011 . The intervention involved 2 weeks of learning about using the National Institutes of Health 's SeniorHealth.gov website to access reliable health information . The intervention took place at public libraries . Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental condition ( collaborative : n = 72 ; individualistic : n = 74 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Overall , participants ' knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy all improved significantly from pre to post intervention ( P < .001 in all cases ; effect sizes were > 0.8 with statistical power of 1.00 even at the .01 level in all cases ) . When controlling for baseline differences , no significant main effect of the learning method was found on computer / Web knowledge , skills , or eHealth literacy efficacy . Thus , collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes . No significant interaction effect of learning method and time of measurement was found . Group composition based on gender , familiarity with peers , or prior computer experience had no significant main or interaction effect on the learning outcomes . Regardless of the specific learning method used , participants had overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward the intervention and reported positive changes in participation in their own health care as a result of the intervention . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The findings provide strong evidence that the eHealth literacy intervention tested in this study , regardless of the specific learning method used , significantly improved knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy from pre to post intervention , was positively perceived by participants , and led to positive changes in their own health care . Collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes , suggesting the previously widely reported advantages of collaborative over individualistic learning may not be easily applied to the older population in informal settings , though several confounding factors might have contributed to this finding ( ie , the largely inexperienced computer user composition of the study sample , potential instructor effect , and ceiling effect ) .

Therefore , it is relevant and necessary to systematically manipulate website characteristics to test their effect on website use . This study focuses on user control as a website characteristic . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To test whether and how user control ( the freedom of choice to skip pages ) can increase website use and knowledge gained from the website . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants older than 18 years were drawn from the Dutch Internet population ( in June 2011 ) and completed a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire . Subsequently , they were randomly assigned to three groups : ( 1 ) a tunneled version of the website with less user control ; ( 2 ) a high user control version of the website where visitors had the freedom of choice to skip pages ; and ( 3 ) a control group that was not exposed to the website . Participants completed ( 1 ) a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website ( except for the control group ) , and ( 2 ) a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire after one week to test whether participants in the experimental groups only clicked through the website or actually processed and learned its content . Server registrations were used to assess website use . Analyses of covariance ( ANCOVA ) using all available data were conducted to determine whether user control increases website use . Structural equation models ( SEM ) using all available data were constructed to test how user control increases website use — a latent variable derived from number of pages visited and time on website . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 1044 persons invited to participate , 668 took part ( 668/1044 , 64.0 % ) . One half of participants ( 332/668 49.7 % ) were female and the mean age was 49 years ( SD 16 ) . A total of 571 participants completed the one - week follow - up measure regarding hepatitis knowledge ( 571/668 , 85.5 % ) . The findings demonstrate that having less user control ( ie , a tunneled version of the website ) had a negative effect on users ' perception of efficiency ( F1,452 = 97.69 , P < .001 ) , but a positive effect on number of pages visited ( F1,452 = 171.49 , P < .001 ) , time on the website ( F1,452 = 6.32 , P = .01 ) , and knowledge gained from the website ( F1,452 = 134.32 , P < .001 ) . The direct effect of having less user control appeared to surpass the effect mediated by efficiency , because website use was higher among participants exposed to the tunneled version of the website in comparison with those having the freedom of choice to skip pages .

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to conduct a cost - effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) of adding a non - stimulant , guanfacine extended release ( GXR ) , to stimulants versus maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness from a US third - party payer perspective . Effectiveness was measured by the QALY . The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states ( normal , mild , moderate and severe ) , defined by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI - S ) scale . Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient - level data from a multicentre , 9-week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - optimization study , where subjects ( n=461 ) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning , GXR administered in the evening , or placebo . The model assumed that patients in moderate / severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period . Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs , all in $ US , year 2010 values . Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks . Oneway sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis ( PSA ) were conducted by varying costs , utilities , adverse - event duration , and transition probabilities . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy , adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $ US1016 but a lower medical cost of $ US124 , resulting in a total incremental cost of $ US892 at 1 year . The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of $ US31 660 / QALY . In one - way sensitivity analysis , ICER values ranged from $ US19 723 , when 100 % of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state , to $ US46631 , when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period . PSA demonstrated a 94.6 % likelihood that the ICER falls below $ US50 000 / QALY . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized . This is the first analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive medication . This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with stimulants is a cost - effective treatment based on a willingness - to - pay threshold of $ US50 000 / QALY . This may address an unmet need among patients with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy .",attention,"Stimulant plus non-stimulant, guanfacine extended release (GXR) || Stimulant || medical cost","[(393, 438)]",1,dev,lime

The purpose of this study was to compare the behavioral characteristics between Chinese school - age children ( 6 to 11 years of age ) with and without unintentional injuries and to identify behavioral risk factors for school - age children with unintentional injury . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This cross - sectional predictive study was conducted in five elementary schools in Daqing , China . The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) was used to assess the children 's behavioral characteristics . A total of 725 school - age children were screened . Of these , 116 children who had experienced unintentional injury in the past year were recruited as the study group , and 123 children who had not experienced an unintentional injury were randomly selected and assigned to the control group . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The total scores of CBCL in the study group children were significantly higher than those in the control group . The significant behavior disorder predictors for unintentional injury in boys were schizoid behavior problem ( OR = 2.43 ) , anxiety / depression ( OR = 2.76 ) and hyperactive ( OR = 2.42 ) . The predictors for unintentional injury in girls were anxiety / depression ( OR = 2.12 ) and delinquent behavior ( OR = 2.81 ) .

A social learning intervention , incorporating environment , motivation , education , and self - efficacy to change behaviour , was implemented in a low - income district of northern Ghana to increase adolescent services usage . This study aimed to assess the impact of this intervention on usage of sexual and reproductive health services by young people . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - six communities were randomly allocated to ( i ) an intervention consisting of school - based curriculum , out - of - school outreach , community mobilisation , and health - worker training in youth - friendly health services , or ( ii ) comparison consisting of community mobilisation and youth - friendly health services training only . Outcome measures were usage of sexually - transmitted infections ( STIs ) management , HIV counselling and testing , antenatal care or perinatal services in the past year and reported service satisfaction . Data was collected , at baseline and three years after , from a cohort of 2,664 adolescents aged 15–17 at baseline . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Exposure was associated with over twice the odds of using STI services ( AOR 2.47 ; 95%CI 1.78–3.42 ) , 89 % greater odds of using perinatal services ( AOR 1.89 ; 95%CI 1.37–2.60 ) and 56 % greater odds of using antenatal services ( AOR 1.56 ; 95%CI 1.10–2.20 ) among participants in intervention versus comparison communities , after adjustment for baseline differences .

The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of a single intra - articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells ( MPCs ) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In this phase Ib / IIa , double - blind , active comparator clinical study , 17 patients aged 18–40 years with unilateral ACL reconstruction were randomized ( 2:1 ) to receive either a single intra - articular injection of 75 million allogeneic MPCs suspended in hyaluronan ( HA ) ( MPC + HA group ) ( n = 11 ) or HA alone ( n = 6 ) . Patients were monitored for adverse events . Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti - HLA panel reactive antibodies ( PRA ) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry . Pain , function , and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) and SF-36v2 scores . Joint space width was measured from radiographs , and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + HA group and 0 out of 6 HA controls . No cell - related serious adverse effects were observed . Increases in class I PRA > 10 % were observed at week 4 in the MPC + HA group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104 . Compared with the HA group , MPC + HA - treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain , symptom , activities of daily living , and SF-36 bodily pain scores ( p < 0.05 ) . The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing ( p < 0.05 ) , less tibial bone expansion ( 0.5 % vs 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.02 ) , and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss ( 0.7 % vs – 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.10 ) than the HA controls . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intra - articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following ACL reconstruction was safe , well tolerated , and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes . These findings suggest that MPCs warrant further investigations as they may modulate some of the pathological processes responsible for the development of post - traumatic osteoarthritis following ACL reconstruction .

Improvement of respiratory function is therefore an important objective in MG therapy . A previous study demonstrated that respiratory muscle endurance training ( RMET ) over four weeks increased respiratory muscle endurance of MG patients to about 200 % of baseline . The purpose of the present study was to establish an appropriate maintenance training and to test its effects over four months . Ten patients with mild to moderate MG participated in this study . During the first month , they performed five training sessions per week . For the following 3 months , training frequency was reduced to five sessions per two weeks . Myasthenia score , lung function , and respiratory endurance were determined prior to training , after the first month , and after 4 months . Myasthenia score improved from 0.71 ± 0.1 to 0.56 ± 0.1 ( P = 0.007 ) . Respiratory endurance time increased from 6.1 ± 0.8 to 20.3 ± 3.0 min ( P < 0.001 ) .

The two active treatments lowered fasting glucose levels to the same extent . The decreases in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) observed with the two higher doses of MSDC-0160 were not different from those associated with pioglitazone . By contrast , fluid retention as evidenced by reduction in hematocrit , red blood cells , and total hemoglobin was 50 % less in the MSDC-0160–treated groups . There was also a smaller increase in high - molecular - weight ( HMW ) adiponectin with MSDC-0160 than with pioglitazone ( P < 0.0001 ) , suggesting that MSDC-0160 produces less expansion of white adipose tissue .

163,163,4145879_5,4145879,"TITLE : Is transcranial direct current stimulation a potential method for improving response inhibition ? ABSTRACT : Inhibitory control of movement in motor learning requires the ability to suppress an inappropriate action , a skill needed to stop a planned or ongoing motor response in response to changes in a variety of environments . This study used a stop - signal task to determine whether transcranial direct - current stimulation over the pre - supplementary motor area alters the reaction time in motor inhibition . Forty healthy subjects were recruited for this study and were randomly assigned to either the transcranial direct - current stimulation condition or a sham - transcranial direct - current stimulation condition . All subjects consecutively performed the stop - signal task before , during , and after the delivery of anodal transcranial direct - current stimulation over the pre - supplementary motor area ( pre - transcranial direct - current stimulation phase , transcranial direct - current stimulation phase , and post - transcranial direct - current stimulation phase ) . Compared to the sham condition , there were significant reductions in the stop - signal processing times during and after transcranial direct - current stimulation , and change times were significantly greater in the transcranial direct - current stimulation condition . There was no significant change in go processing - times during or after transcranial direct - current stimulation in either condition . Anodal transcranial direct - current stimulation was feasibly coupled to an interactive improvement in inhibitory control . This coupling led to a decrease in the stop - signal process time required for the appropriate responses between motor execution and inhibition . However , there was no transcranial direct - current stimulation effect on the no - signal reaction time during the stop - signal task . Transcranial direct - current stimulation can adjust certain behaviors , and it could be a useful clinical intervention for patients who have difficulties with response inhibition .",attention,Transcranial direct-current stimulation condition || Control || No-signal reaction time,"[(280, 305)]",1,dev,attention

It has been suggested that the loss of the prophylactic effect of presumptive - administered ACT in children who do not have malaria will result in increase in their risk of malaria and anaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : We undertook a cluster - randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of the presumptive approach using clinical judgment ( CJ - arm ) and the test - based approach using RDTs ( RDT - arm in a high - transmission setting in Ghana . A total of 3046 eligible children ( 1527 in the RDT arm and 1519 in the CJ- arm ) living around 32 health centres were enrolled . Nearly half were female ( 48.7 % ) and 47.8 % were below the age of 12 months as at enrolment . Over 24-months , the incidence of all episodes of malaria following the first febrile illness was 0.64 ( 95 % CI 0.49–0.82 ) and 0.76 ( 0.63–0.93 ) per child per year in the RDT and CJ arms respectively ( adjusted rate ratio 1.13 ( 0.82–1.55 ) .

However , pneumoperitoneum can pose risks to the kidneys by causing a decrease in renal blood flow . Furthermore , as in other surgical procedures , laparoscopic bariatric surgery triggers an acute inflammatory response . Neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin is an early and accurate biomarker of renal injury , as well as of the inflammatory response . Anesthetic drugs could offer some protection for the kidneys and could attenuate the acute inflammatory response from surgical trauma . The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two types of anesthetics , propofol and sevoflurane , on the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Sixty - four patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized into two anesthesia groups and were administered either total intravenous anesthesia ( propofol ) or inhalation anesthesia ( sevoflurane ) . In the perioperative period , blood samples were collected at three time points ( before anesthesia , 6 hours after pneumoperitoneum and 24 hours after pneumoperitoneum ) and urine output was measured for 24 hours .
