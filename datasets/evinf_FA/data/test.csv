Nevertheless , it is not well - known whether learning therapy improve a wide range of cognitive functions or not . We investigated the beneficial effects of learning therapy on various cognitive functions in healthy older adults . Methods : We used a single - blinded intervention with two groups ( learning therapy group : LT and waiting list control group : WL ) . Sixty - four elderly were randomly assigned to LT or WL . In LT , participants performed reading Japanese aloud and solving simple calculations training tasks for 6 months . WL did not participate in the intervention . We measured several cognitive functions before and after 6 months intervention periods . Results : Compared to WL , results revealed that LT improved inhibition performance in executive functions ( Stroop : LT ( Mean = 3.88 ) vs. WL ( Mean = 1.22 ) , adjusted p = 0.013 and reverse Stroop LT ( Mean = 3.22 ) vs. WL ( Mean = 1.59 ) , adjusted p = 0.015 ) , verbal episodic memory ( Logical Memory ( LM ) : LT ( Mean = 4.59 ) vs. WL ( Mean = 2.47 ) , adjusted p = 0.015 ) , focus attention ( D - CAT : LT ( Mean = 2.09 ) vs. WL ( Mean = −0.59 ) , adjusted p = 0.010 ) and processing speed compared to the WL control group ( digit symbol coding : LT ( Mean = 5.00 ) vs. WL ( Mean = 1.13 ) , adjusted p = 0.015 and Symbol Search ( SS ) : LT ( Mean = 3.47 ) vs. WL ( Mean = 1.81 ) , adjusted p = 0.014 ) .

458,458,4336131_3,4336131,"TITLE : Effects of Rikkunshito ( traditional Japanese medicine ) on enteral feeding and the plasma ghrelin level in critically ill patients : a pilot study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Rikkunshito is a traditional Japanese medicine that has been widely prescribed for patients with various gastrointestinal symptoms . Recently , the prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito in patients with a variety of diseases have attracted attention in Japan . The prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito are believed to result from an increase of active ghrelin , which is most abundant in the stomach and which has a gastrokinetic function . The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effects of Rikkunshito on intragastric enteral feeding and plasma ghrelin levels in critically ill patients . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The study population consisted of critically ill patients who were projected to require intragastric tube feeding for more than 7 days . The patients were prospectively assigned to one of two treatment groups and were randomized to receive either Rikkunshito ( 2.5 g ) or metoclopramide ( 10 mg ) every 8 h. All patients received standard enteral nutrition . Patients in both groups were begun on intragastric tube feeding according to our institution 's feeding protocol . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : All patients were undergoing mechanical ventilation at the time of enrollment . The portions of enteral nutrition provided to the target amount and the quantity of gastric discharge were not statistically significantly different between the two groups . The Rikkunshito group reached 50 % of the target amount of enteral feeding significantly earlier than the metoclopramide group , although the proportion of patients in whom enteral feeding was successful did not differ significantly between the two groups . Patients in the Rikkunshito group showed significantly higher plasma levels of active ghrelin compared to those in the metoclopramide group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The administration of Rikkunshito increased the plasma level of active ghrelin , and induced prokinetic effects that were greater than those observed following treatment with metoclopramide in critically ill patients .

Therefore , it is relevant and necessary to systematically manipulate website characteristics to test their effect on website use . This study focuses on user control as a website characteristic . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To test whether and how user control ( the freedom of choice to skip pages ) can increase website use and knowledge gained from the website . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants older than 18 years were drawn from the Dutch Internet population ( in June 2011 ) and completed a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire . Subsequently , they were randomly assigned to three groups : ( 1 ) a tunneled version of the website with less user control ; ( 2 ) a high user control version of the website where visitors had the freedom of choice to skip pages ; and ( 3 ) a control group that was not exposed to the website . Participants completed ( 1 ) a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website ( except for the control group ) , and ( 2 ) a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire after one week to test whether participants in the experimental groups only clicked through the website or actually processed and learned its content . Server registrations were used to assess website use . Analyses of covariance ( ANCOVA ) using all available data were conducted to determine whether user control increases website use . Structural equation models ( SEM ) using all available data were constructed to test how user control increases website use — a latent variable derived from number of pages visited and time on website . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 1044 persons invited to participate , 668 took part ( 668/1044 , 64.0 % ) . One half of participants ( 332/668 49.7 % ) were female and the mean age was 49 years ( SD 16 ) . A total of 571 participants completed the one - week follow - up measure regarding hepatitis knowledge ( 571/668 , 85.5 % ) . The findings demonstrate that having less user control ( ie , a tunneled version of the website ) had a negative effect on users ' perception of efficiency ( F1,452 = 97.69 , P < .001 ) , but a positive effect on number of pages visited ( F1,452 = 171.49 , P < .001 ) , time on the website ( F1,452 = 6.32 , P = .01 ) , and knowledge gained from the website ( F1,452 = 134.32 , P < .001 ) . The direct effect of having less user control appeared to surpass the effect mediated by efficiency , because website use was higher among participants exposed to the tunneled version of the website in comparison with those having the freedom of choice to skip pages . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The key finding that visitors demonstrated increased website use in the tunneled version of the website indicates that visitors should be carefully guided through the intervention for future intervention websites .",scaled attention,High user control || Low user control || Knowledge gained on the site,"[(436, 485)]",2,test,scaled attention

The dietary treatments were mulberry leaf pellet ( MUP ) supplementation at 0 , 200 , 400 and 600 g / hd / d with rice straw fed to allow ad libitum intake . All steers were kept in individual pens and supplemented with concentrate at 5 g / kg of body weight daily . The experiment was 4 periods , and each lasted 21 d. During the first 14 d , all steers were fed their respective diets ad libitum and during the last 7 d , they were moved to metabolism crates for total urine and fecal collection . It was found that increasing MUP levels resulted in linearly increasing rice straw and total intakes ( p<0.05 ) . Ruminal temperature and pH were not significantly affected by MUP supplementation while NH3-N concentration was increased ( p<0.05 ) and maintained at a high level ( 18.5 mg / dl ) with supplementation of MUP at 600 g / hd / d . Similarly , viable total bacteria in the rumen and cellulolytic bacteria were enriched by MUP supplementation at 600 g / hd / d . However , the rumen microbial diversity determined with a PCR - DGGE technique showed similar methanogenic diversity between treatments and sampling times and were similar at a 69 % genetic relationship as determined by a UPGMA method . Based on this study , it could be concluded that supplementation of MUP at 600 g / hd / d improved DM intake , ruminal NH3-N , and cellulolytic bacteria thus iimproving rumen ecology in beef cattle fed with rice straw .",others,Mulberry leaf pellet at 600 g/hd/d || Mulberry leaf pellet at 200 g/hd/d || Total viable rumen bacteria,"[(210, 234)]",0,test,scaled attention

324,324,1693558_2,1693558,"TITLE : Low - frequency vibratory exercise reduces the risk of bone fracture more than walking : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Whole - body vibration ( WBV ) is a new type of exercise that has been increasingly tested for the ability to prevent bone fractures and osteoporosis in frail people . There are two currently marketed vibrating plates : a ) the whole plate oscillates up and down ; b ) reciprocating vertical displacements on the left and right side of a fulcrum , increasing the lateral accelerations . A few studies have shown recently the effectiveness of the up - and - down plate for increasing Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) and balance ; but the effectiveness of the reciprocating plate technique remains mainly unknown . The aim was to compare the effects of WBV using a reciprocating platform at frequencies lower than 20 Hz and a walking - based exercise programme on BMD and balance in post - menopausal women . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - eight physically untrained post - menopausal women were assigned at random to a WBV group or a Walking group . Both experimental programmes consisted of 3 sessions per week for 8 months . Each vibratory session included 6 bouts of 1 min ( 12.6 Hz in frequency and 3 cm in amplitude with 60 ° of knee flexion ) with 1 min rest between bouts . Each walking session was 55 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of stretching . Hip and lumbar BMD ( g·cm-2 ) were measured using dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry and balance was assessed by the blind flamingo test . ANOVA for repeated measurements was adjusted by baseline data , weight and age . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After 8 months , BMD at the femoral neck in the WBV group was increased by 4.3 % ( P = 0.011 ) compared to the Walking group . In contrast , the BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both groups . Balance was improved in the WBV group ( 29 % ) but not in the Walking group .

Alginate oligosaccharide ( AOS ) , a natural product , has antitumor activities and may have therapeutic effects in osteosarcoma , the molecular mechanisms of which remain unclear . AOS was prepared from alginate sodium using alginate lyase . The fractions of AOS were further isolated by size - exclusion chromatography and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI - MS ) . Osteosarcoma patients were enrolled in the study and assigned into two groups : AOS ( AG , oral administration of 10-mg AOS daily ) and control groups ( CG , placebo ) . Preoperative and postoperative clinical data were investigated and analyzed . Four different degrees of polymerizations ( DPs ) were isolated and denominated as DP2 , DP3 , DP4 , and DP5 . Among these polymers , only DP5 showed antitumor functions on osteosarcoma cells . Before surgery and the outcome of primary end point after surgery , no significant differences were observed for clinical data and tumor size between the AG and CG groups ( P > 0.05 ) . After 2-year therapy , the mean tumor volume was 214.6 ± 145.7 c.c . in AG and 467.2 ± 225.3 c.c in CG ( P < 0.01 ) . The rate of local recurrence was 44.9 and 68.7 % in AG and CG , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) .

510,510,5620095_3,5620095,"TITLE : A Novel Roux - en - Y Reconstruction Involving the Use of Two Circular Staplers after Distal Subtotal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer ABSTRACT.PURPOSE : Although Roux - en - Y ( R - Y ) reconstruction after distal gastrectomy has several advantages , such as prevention of bile reflux into the remnant stomach , it is rarely used because of the technical difficulty . This prospective randomized clinical trial aimed to show the efficacy of a novel method of R - Y reconstruction involving the use of 2 circular staplers by comparing this novel method to Billroth - I ( B - I ) reconstruction . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 118 patients were randomly allocated into the R - Y ( 59 patients ) and B - I reconstruction ( 59 patients ) groups . R - Y anastomosis was performed using two circular staplers and no hand sewing . The primary end - point of this clinical trial was the reflux of bile into the remnant stomach evaluated using endoscopic and histological findings at 6 months after surgery . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : No significant differences in clinicopathological findings were observed between the 2 groups . Although anastomosis time was significantly longer for the patients of the R - Y group ( P<0.001 ) , no difference was detected between the 2 groups in terms of the total surgery duration ( P=0.112 ) . Endoscopic findings showed a significant reduction of bile reflux in the remnant stomach in the R - Y group ( P<0.001 ) , and the histological findings showed that reflux gastritis was more significant in the B - I group than in the R - Y group ( P=0.026 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The results of this randomized controlled clinical trial showed that compared with B - I reconstruction , R - Y reconstruction using circular staplers is a safe and feasible procedure .

Our objective was to justify the anti - inflammatory effect of dextran-70 following cardiac operations . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery ( n = 32 ) or aortic valve replacement ( n = 8) were enrolled in this prospective , randomized , double - blind study . Two groups were formed . In group A ( n = 20 ) , dextran-70 infusion was administered at a dose of 7.5 ml / kg before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and at a dose of 12.5 ml / kg after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass . Group B served as a control with identical amounts of gelatin infusion ( n = 20 ) . The plasma concentration of procalcitonin , C - reactive protein , IL 6 , IL 6r , IL 8 , IL 10 , soluble endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , cardiac troponin - I and various haemodynamic parameters were measured in the perioperative period . Multivariate methods were used for statistical analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In group A , lower peak ( median ) plasma levels of procalcitonin ( 0.2 versus 1.4 , p < 0.001 ) , IL 8 ( 5.6 versus 94.8 , p < 0.001 ) , IL 10 ( 47.2 versus 209.7 , p = 0.001 ) , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 ( 88.5 versus 130.6 , p = 0.033 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( 806.7 versus 1,375.7 , P = 0.001 ) and troponin - I ( 0.22 versus 0.66 , p = 0.018 ) were found . There was no significant difference in IL 6 , IL-6r and C - reactive protein values between groups . Higher figures of the cardiac index ( p = 0.010 ) along with reduced systemic vascular resistance ( p = 0.005 ) were noted in group A.

691,691,5381869_0,5381869,"TITLE : Transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation induces lasting fatigue resistance and enhances explosive vertical jump performance ABSTRACT : Transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation ( tsDCS ) is a non - invasive neuromodulatory intervention that has been shown to modify excitability in spinal and supraspinal circuits in animals and humans . Our objective in this study was to explore the functional neuromodulatory potential of tsDCS by examining its immediate and lasting effects over the repeated performance of a whole body maximal exercise in healthy volunteers . Using a double - blind , randomized , crossover , sham - controlled design we investigated the effects of 15 min of anodal tsDCS on repeated vertical countermovement jump ( VCJ ) performance at 0 , 20 , 60 , and 180 minutes post - stimulation . Measurements of peak and take - off velocity , vertical displacement , peak power and work done during countermovement and push - off VCJ phases were derived from changes in vertical ground reaction force ( 12 performance parameters ) in 12 healthy participants . The magnitude and direction of change in VCJ performance from pre- to post - stimulation differed significantly between sham and active tsDCS for 7 of the 12 VCJ performance measures ( P < 0.05 ) . These differences comprised of a post - sham fatigue in VCJ displacement / work done , peak to peak power and take - off velocity , and a resilience to this fatigue effect post - active tsDCS . In addition there was also an enhancement of countermovement performance and total work done ( P < 0.05 ) . These changes did not vary across repeated VCJ performances over time post - tsDCS ( P > 0.05 ) . Our original findings demonstrate that one single session of anodal tsDCS in healthy subjects can prevent fatigue and maintain or enhance different aspects of whole body explosive motor power over repeated sets of VCJs performed over a period of three hours . The observed effects are discussed in relation to alterations in central fatigue mechanisms , muscle contraction mode during jump execution and changes in spinal cord excitability . These findings have important implications for power endurance sport performance and for neuromotor rehabilitation .",attention,Active anodal tsDCS || Sham tsDCS || Countermovement velocity,"[(253, 270)]",1,test,attention

Stress reduction is particularly helpful , but face - to - face delivery systems can not reach all those who might benefit . An online , 3-dimensional virtual world may be able to support the rich interpersonal interactions required of this approach . In this pilot study , we explore the feasibility of translating a face - to - face stress reduction program into an online virtual setting and estimate the effect size of the intervention . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : Domain experts in virtual world technology joined with mind body practitioners to translate an existing 8 week relaxation response - based resiliency program into an 8-week virtual world - based program in Second LifeTM ( SL ) . Twenty - four healthy volunteers with at least one month 's experience in SL completed the program . Each subject filled out the Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) and the Symptom Checklist 90- Revised ( SCL-90-R ) before and after taking part . Participants took part in one of 3 groups of about 10 subjects . The participants found the program to be helpful and enjoyable . Many reported that the virtual environment was an excellent substitute for the preferred face - to - face approach . On quantitative measures , there was a general trend toward decreased perceived stress , ( 15.7 to 15.0 ) , symptoms of depression , ( 57.6 to 57.0 ) and anxiety ( 56.8 to 54.8 ) . There was a significant decrease of 2.8 points on the SCL-90-R Global Severity Index ( p<0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This pilot project showed that it is feasible to deliver a typical mind - body medical intervention through a virtual environment and that it is well received . Moreover , the small reduction in psychological distress suggests further research is warranted . Based on the data collected for this project , a randomized trial with less than 50 subjects would be appropriately powered if perceived stress is the primary outcome .",scaled attention,Second Life program || No program || Global Severity Index of the SCL 90-r,"[(273, 291)]",2,test,scaled attention
529,529,3651817_0,3651817,"TITLE : Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of moist inhalation epinephrine using a mobile inhaler ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Intramuscular ( L-)epinephrine is used as self - medication for serious hypersensitivity reactions . Inhalative administration has the theoretical advantage of a more rapid absorption and better controllability . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : The current trial was conducted to explore pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two nebulized inhalative epinephrine doses ( 4 mg and 8 mg in aqueous solution ) using a mobile pocket inhaler relative to intramuscular administration ( 0.3 mg ) and placebo . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This randomized , open - label , change - over pilot study involved eight young healthy men and women . Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were calculated from epinephrine plasma concentrations and hemodynamic parameters . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Mean exposure to epinephrine decreased from the 8 mg dose to the 4 mg inhalative dose , and further with the 0.3 mg intramuscular dose , with active treatments showing significantly higher concentrations than placebo ( geometric mean area under the curve AUC0-t(last ) values : 282 , 236 , 204 and 81.6 hr*ng / L ) . Maximal concentrations were reached within approximately 15 min for all active treatments . Epinephrine effects for inhalative administrations on heart rates were significantly higher than those for the intramuscular or placebo administration , while no excessive effects occurred . Pronounced overall variability prohibited a definite assessment of relative bioavailability between treatments . However , results indicated that epinephrine concentrations obtained following the 8 mg inhalative dose were not inferior to those after 0.3 mg i.m . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : A relevant fraction of moist inhalation epinephrine doses is absorbed and mediates systemic effects . This suggests that administration of epinephrine via a suitable pocket inhaler device may be beneficial in ambulatory emergency treatment of systemic hypersensitivity reactions .

ABSTRACT.ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS : Patients were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg , empagliflozin 25 mg , or placebo . Seven thousand and twenty patients were treated ; 706 ( 10.1 % ) had heart failure at baseline . Heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death occurred in a significantly lower percentage of patients treated with empagliflozin [ 265/4687 patients ( 5.7 % ) ] than with placebo [ 198/2333 patients ( 8.5 % ) ] [ hazard ratio , HR : 0.66 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.55–0.79 ) ; P < 0.001 ] , corresponding to a number needed to treat to prevent one heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death of 35 over 3 years . Consistent effects of empagliflozin were observed across subgroups defined by baseline characteristics , including patients with vs. without heart failure , and across categories of medications to treat diabetes and/or heart failure . Empagliflozin improved other heart failure outcomes , including hospitalization for or death from heart failure [ 2.8 vs. 4.5 % ; HR : 0.61 ( 0.47–0.79 ) ; P < 0.001 ] and was associated with a reduction in all - cause hospitalization [ 36.8 vs. 39.6 % ; HR : 0.89 ( 0.82–0.96 ) ; P = 0.003 ] .

The decreases in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) observed with the two higher doses of MSDC-0160 were not different from those associated with pioglitazone . By contrast , fluid retention as evidenced by reduction in hematocrit , red blood cells , and total hemoglobin was 50 % less in the MSDC-0160–treated groups . There was also a smaller increase in high - molecular - weight ( HMW ) adiponectin with MSDC-0160 than with pioglitazone ( P < 0.0001 ) , suggesting that MSDC-0160 produces less expansion of white adipose tissue .

Mycophenolate might be an alternative therapy to avoid toxicities of cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) . This study was aimed to compare enteric - coated mycophenolate sodium ( EC - MPS ) versus intravenous CYC as an induction therapy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The study was a 12-month period of multicentre , open - labelled randomised controlled trial . Fifty - nine patients who had relapsed ( 36 % ) or who were resistant to previous CYC treatment ( 64 % ) and all who were biopsy - proven class III / IV , were randomised into CYC ( n=32 ) and EC - MPS groups ( n=27 ) . The CYC group received intravenous CYC 0.5–1 g / m2 monthly and the EC - MPS group was treated with EC - MPS 1440 mg / day for first 6 months . After induction therapy , both groups received EC - MPS 720 mg / day until the end of study at 12 months . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The study was prematurely terminated due to high rate of serious adverse events in CYC arm . Death and serious infections were observed more in the CYC group ( 15.6 % in CYC and 3.5 % in EC - MPS ; p=0.04 ) . The early discontinuation rates , mainly from serious infections , were significantly higher in CYC group ( percentage differences of 16.9 ; 95 % CI 1.3 to 32.4 ) . At the 12th month , both arms were comparable in terms of complete and partial remission rates ( 68 % CYC and 71 % EC - MPS ) and times to remission ( 96 days CYC and 97 days EC - MPS ) . Composites of unfavourable outcomes ( death , doubling of serum creatinine , non - remission and intolerance to treatment ) were 46.9 % and 37 % in CYC and EC - MPS ( risk difference=9.84 ; p=0.44 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : EC - MPS may have comparable efficacy , but was better tolerated than CYC . EC - MPS should be an alternative choice of treatment for difficult - to - treat LN , particularly in CYC - experienced LN patients .

Its prevalence increases with age and duration of diabetes . It is more common in patients who have suboptimal glycemic control over several years . Because DPN may be resistant to conventional treatments , it is common for patients to only have partial pain relief . Therefore , new therapeutic options are needed for the condition . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : : The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) and pulsed radiofrequency ( PRF ) lumbar sympathectomy in treating painful DPN . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : : Sixty - five patients with painful DPN refractory to conventional treatment were randomly and evenly assigned to either the TENS or PRF lumbar sympathectomy groups . Pain evaluations were based on the 10-point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . Subjects were followed for three months and had a total of four study visits ( baseline and 1 week , 1 month , and 3 months after treatment ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Sixty patients completed all study visits . In both groups , the NRS rating significantly decreased after treatment , with a marked pain reduction observed at the first follow - up evaluation . In the PRF group , the NRS decreased from 6.46 at baseline to 2.76 at the 1 week visit . One and 3 months after treatment , the NRS was 4.30 and 5.13 , respectively ( P < 0.0001 ) .

The current marketed rifaximin formulation contains polymorph alpha , the systemic bioavailability of which is very limited . This study compared the pharmacokinetics of this formulation with those of the amorphous form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Amorphous rifaximin was specifically prepared for the study and formulated as the marketed product . Two doses ( 200 mg and 400 mg ) of both formulations were given to two groups of 12 healthy volunteers of either sex according to a single - blind , randomized , two - treatment , single - dose , two - period , cross - over design . Plasma and urine samples were collected at preset times ( for 24 hours or 48 hours , respectively ) after dosing , and assayed for rifaximin concentrations by high - performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : For both dose levels , peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and cumulative urinary excretion were significantly higher after administration of amorphous rifaximin than rifaximin - α . Ninety percent confidence intervals for peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and urinary excretion ratios were largely outside the upper limit of the accepted ( 0.80–1.25 ) range , indicating higher systemic bioavailability of the amorphous rifaximin .

Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory , while the reverser stimulation had no effect . Meaning that bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working memory . Further studies are required to understand subtle effects of different tDCS stimulation / inhibition electrode positioning on the working memory .",attention,Transcranial direct current stimulation || Control || Working memory speed,"[(229, 239)]",1,test,attention
622,622,4889193_2,4889193,"TITLE : Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Initiation and Dose Uptitration in Children With Cardiovascular Disease : A Retrospective Review of Standard Clinical Practice and a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) are a mainstay of medical management in pediatric cardiology . However , there are no data defining how best to initiate and uptitrate the dose of these medications in children . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS : Retrospective chart review revealed only 24 % of our pediatric cardiology inpatients were discharged on predefined optimal doses of ACEIs and few underwent further dose uptitration in the 8 weeks after hospital discharge . Therefore , 2 alternative protocols for initiation of captopril were compared in a prospective randomized clinical trial . A "" rapid uptitration "" protocol reached an optimal dose on day 3 , whereas the alternative , "" prolonged uptitration "" protocol , reached an optimal dose on day 9 . Forty‐6 patients ( 54 % male ) were recruited to the trial , with a median age of 0.7 year ( IQR 0.5–2.3 years ) . Captopril was initiated while in intensive care in 39 % of patients and on the cardiology ward in 61 % . There were no differences between the protocols in episodes of hypotension , symptomatic hypotension , or indices of renal function . Patients following the rapid protocol reached higher doses of captopril ( 0.93±0.24 versus 0.57±0.38 mg / kg per dose , P<0.0001 ) and were more likely to have achieved the predefined target ( 88 % versus 43 % , P=0.002 ) and optimal ACEI doses ( 80 % versus 29 % , P=0.001 ) before discharge . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : A protocol of rapid ACEI dose uptitration for infants and children with cardiovascular disease can be introduced safely , even in patients receiving intensive care therapy . Compared with standard clinical practice or with a more prolonged protocol , rapid ACEI dose uptitration achieves a higher dosage in this population with no evident disadvantages .

679,679,4296355_4,4296355,"TITLE : Efficacy of clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block : A prospective study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS : : Bupivacaine has been the most frequently used local anaesthetic in brachial plexus block , but ropivacaine has also been successfully tried in the recent past . It is less cardiotoxic , less arrhythmogenic , less toxic to the central nervous system than bupivacaine , and it has intrinsic vasoconstrictor property . The effects of clonidine have been studied in peripheral nerve blockade . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of clonidine on nerve blockade during brachial plexus block with ropivacaine using peripheral nerve stimulator . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups , Group A and B. Group A received 30 ml of 0.5 % of ropivacaine with 0.5 ml normal saline while Group B received same amount of ropivacaine with 0.5 ml ( equivalent to 75 μg ) of clonidine for supraclavicular brachial plexus block . The groups were compared regarding quality of sensory and motor blockade , duration of post - operative analgesia and intra and post - operative complications . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There was a significant increase in duration of motor and sensory block and analgesia in Group B as compared to Group A patients ( P < 0.0001 ) . There was no significant difference in onset time in either group ( P = 0.304 ) . No significant side effects were noted . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : The addition of 75 μg of clonidine to ropivacaine for brachial plexus block prolongs motor and sensory block and analgesia without significant side effects .",scaled attention,Ropivacaine (group A) || Ropivacaine plus clonidine (group B) || Side effects,"[(244, 251)]",2,test,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A post hoc analysis of a phase 3 trial assessing micafungin ( 100 mg / day for subjects > 40 kg ; 2 mg / kg / day for subjects ≤ 40 kg ) versus liposomal amphotericin B ( 3 mg / kg / day ) . Subgroups were defined according to the type of ward on the first day of treatment : intensive care unit ( ICU ) or non - ICU . Multivariate regression was performed to identify factors associated with treatment success at end of therapy and all - cause mortality at days 8 and 30 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In non - ICU subjects , treatment success was significantly higher for micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B ( 85 % ( n = 108/127 ) versus 72.1 % ( n = 98/136 ) ; P = 0.0113 ) . However , for ICU subjects , treatment success rates for micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B were similar ( 62.5 % ( n = 75/120 ) versus 66.4 % ( n = 73/110 ) ; P = 0.5828 ) . Overall , treatment success was significantly lower in ICU subjects compared with non - ICU subjects ( 64.3 % ( n = 148/230 ) versus 78.3 % ( n = 206/263 ) ; P = 0.0006 ) . Multivariate regression analysis revealed a lower likelihood of treatment success for : ICU versus non - ICU subjects ; persistent neutropenia ; and high versus low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II scores . However , when interactions between potential explanatory factors were included in the analysis model , ICU status no longer emerged as a significant associated variable but the association between APACHE II score and treatment outcome remained . Further analyses indicated that the likelihood of mortality at day 8 and day 30 was lower for subjects with lower APACHE II scores . Renal function was significantly better in micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B subjects : a difference ( liposomal amphotericin B - micafungin in mean peak change in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( ml / minute/1.73 m2 ) of -18.2 ( P < 0.0001 ) and -17.7 ( P = 0.0124 ) in non - ICU and ICU subjects , respectively . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Overall , ICU subjects had lower treatment success rates than non - ICU subjects for both liposomal amphotericin B and micafungin . Multivariate regression after controlling for potential confounding factors suggested the APACHE II score remained a potential explanatory factor associated with treatment success , mortality at day 8 , and mortality at day 30 .

Mycophenolate might be an alternative therapy to avoid toxicities of cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) . This study was aimed to compare enteric - coated mycophenolate sodium ( EC - MPS ) versus intravenous CYC as an induction therapy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The study was a 12-month period of multicentre , open - labelled randomised controlled trial . Fifty - nine patients who had relapsed ( 36 % ) or who were resistant to previous CYC treatment ( 64 % ) and all who were biopsy - proven class III / IV , were randomised into CYC ( n=32 ) and EC - MPS groups ( n=27 ) . The CYC group received intravenous CYC 0.5–1 g / m2 monthly and the EC - MPS group was treated with EC - MPS 1440 mg / day for first 6 months . After induction therapy , both groups received EC - MPS 720 mg / day until the end of study at 12 months . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The study was prematurely terminated due to high rate of serious adverse events in CYC arm . Death and serious infections were observed more in the CYC group ( 15.6 % in CYC and 3.5 % in EC - MPS ; p=0.04 ) . The early discontinuation rates , mainly from serious infections , were significantly higher in CYC group ( percentage differences of 16.9 ; 95 % CI 1.3 to 32.4 ) . At the 12th month , both arms were comparable in terms of complete and partial remission rates ( 68 % CYC and 71 % EC - MPS ) and times to remission ( 96 days CYC and 97 days EC - MPS ) .

Because of the practical difficulties encountered in improving the nutritional adequacy of traditional complementary foods and the limitations associated with the use of liquid iron supplementation for the treatment and prevention of IDA in infants and young children , recently , home - fortification with multivitamins and minerals sprinkles was recommended . This study aims to compare the effect of twice weekly versus daily supplementation with multivitamins and minerals powder ( MMP ) on anaemia prevalence , haemoglobin concentration , and growth in infants and young children in a rural community in Lao PDR . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A randomized trial was conducted in six rural communities . Children aged 6 to 52 months ( n = 336 ) were randomly assigned to a control group ( n = 110 ) or to one of two intervention groups receiving either two sachets per week ( n = 115 ) or a daily sachet ( n = 111 ) of MMP for 24 weeks ; 331 children completed the study . A finger prick of blood was taken at baseline , at week 12 , and again at week 24 to determine haemoglobin concentration . Anthropometric measurements were taken every 4 weeks . The McNemar test was used to assess within group differences at three time points in the study subjects with anaemia and one - way ANOVA was used to assess changes in mean haemoglobin concentration in the treatment groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : MMP supplementation resulted in significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration and in the reduction of anaemia prevalence in the two treatment groups compared with the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . The severely to moderately anaemic children ( Hb < 100 g / L ) on daily supplementation recovered faster than those on twice weekly supplementation . MMP was well accepted and compliance was high in both treatment groups . Overall , the improvement in the weight for age Z - score was very small and not statistically significant across the three study groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : MMP supplementation had positive effects in reduction of anaemia prevalence and in improving haemoglobin concentration . For severely to moderately anaemic children , daily MMP supplementation was more effective in improving haemoglobin concentration and reducing anaemia prevalence .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Ninety EMS ovarian cyst women with postoperative GnRH - a administration were enrolled in the study , and were randomly divided into Kuntai group , Tibolone group , or blank Control group . The therapeutic strategy in Kuntai group was 4 Kuntai capsules tid , po for 12 weeks after the first GnRH - a injection , while Tibolone 2.5 mg qd , po for 12 weeks in Tibolone group . There was no drug addition in Control group . Climacteric complaints were evaluated by Kupperman menopausal index ( KMI ) and hot flash / sweating score . Liver and renal functions , lipid profile , serum sex hormone levels and endometrial thickness were measured , and the frequency of adverse events in Kuntai and Tibolone groups was recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : ( 1 ) Before GnRH - a therapy , the baseline parameter results were comparable in the three groups ( P > 0.05 ) . ( 2 ) After GnRH - a therapy , KMI and hot flash / sweating scores in all the three groups increased significantly ( P < 0.05 ) . At the 4th week after GnRH - a therapy , KMI and hot flash / sweating score results were as follows : Control group > Kuntai group > Tibolone group ( P < 0.05 ) ; at the 8th and 12th week after GnRH - a therapy , KMI and hot flash / sweating score in Control group were significantly higher than the other two groups ( P < 0.05 ) , and no significant difference was identified between Kuntai and Tibolone group ( P > 0.05 ) . ( 3 ) No statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment ( P > 0.05 ) . ( 4 ) The posttherapeutic serum follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and estradiol ( E2 ) level and endometrial thickness decreased significantly in all the three groups ( P < 0.05 ) . After therapy , serum E2 level in Tibolone group was obviously higher than the other two groups ( P < 0.05 ) , while FSH and LH levels were obviously lower ( P < 0.05 ) . ( 5 ) The incidence of vaginal bleeding , breast distending pain in Tibolne group was obviously higher than Kuntai group ( P < 0 . 05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : Kuntai capsule is effective on the peri - menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative GnRH - a administration to EMS patients , although its clinical effect might be a few weeks later than Tibolone . Kuntai capsule might be a little safer than Tibolone tablet .",scaled attention,"Control || Kuntai, Tibolone || KMI and hot flash/sweating score","[(319, 355)]",2,test,attention
704,704,5697397_2,5697397,"TITLE : Native whey protein with high levels of leucine results in similar post - exercise muscular anabolic responses as regular whey protein : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Protein intake is essential to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis , and the amino acid leucine seems to possess a superior effect on muscle protein synthesis compared to other amino acids . Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey ( WPC-80 ) . This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2 × 20 g of native whey protein , WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind , randomized , partial crossover , controlled study . Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey ( n = 10 ) , in a crossover design , or milk ( n = 12 ) . Supplements were ingested immediately ( 20 g ) and two hours after ( 20 g ) a bout of heavy - load lower body resistance exercise . Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas - chromatography mass spectrometry , muscle phosphorylation of p70S6 K , 4E – BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting , and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [ 2H5]phenylalanine - infusion , gas - chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope - ratio mass spectrometry . Being the main comparison , differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one - way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two - way ANOVA . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk ( P < 0.05 ) . Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6 K than milk 180 min after exercise ( P = 0.03 ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1–3 h hours after exercise with WPC-80 ( 0.119 % ) , and 1–5 h after exercise with native whey ( 0.112 % ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1–5 h after exercise with native whey than with milk ( 0.112 % vs. 0.064 , P = 0.023 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Despite higher - magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey , it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6 K during a 5-h post - exercise period . Native whey increased phosphorylation of p70S6 K and muscle protein synthesis rates to a greater extent than milk during the 5-h post exercise period .

Our objective was to justify the anti - inflammatory effect of dextran-70 following cardiac operations . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery ( n = 32 ) or aortic valve replacement ( n = 8) were enrolled in this prospective , randomized , double - blind study . Two groups were formed . In group A ( n = 20 ) , dextran-70 infusion was administered at a dose of 7.5 ml / kg before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and at a dose of 12.5 ml / kg after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass . Group B served as a control with identical amounts of gelatin infusion ( n = 20 ) . The plasma concentration of procalcitonin , C - reactive protein , IL 6 , IL 6r , IL 8 , IL 10 , soluble endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , cardiac troponin - I and various haemodynamic parameters were measured in the perioperative period . Multivariate methods were used for statistical analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In group A , lower peak ( median ) plasma levels of procalcitonin ( 0.2 versus 1.4 , p < 0.001 ) , IL 8 ( 5.6 versus 94.8 , p < 0.001 ) , IL 10 ( 47.2 versus 209.7 , p = 0.001 ) , endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 ( 88.5 versus 130.6 , p = 0.033 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( 806.7 versus 1,375.7 , P = 0.001 ) and troponin - I ( 0.22 versus 0.66 , p = 0.018 ) were found . There was no significant difference in IL 6 , IL-6r and C - reactive protein values between groups . Higher figures of the cardiac index ( p = 0.010 ) along with reduced systemic vascular resistance ( p = 0.005 ) were noted in group A.

This study assessed these effects of rimonabant in Asian population . A total of 643 patients ( BMI 25 kg / m2 or greater without diabetes ) from China , Republic of Korea , and Taiwan were prescribed a hypocaloric diet ( 600 kcal / day deficit ) and randomized to rimonabant 20 mg ( n = 318 ) or placebo ( n = 325 ) for 9months . The primary efficacy variable was weight change from baseline after 9 months of treatment . Results showed that rimonabant group lost more weight than placebo , ( LSM ± SEM of −4.7 ± 0.3 kg vs. −1.7 ± 0.3 kg , P < .0001 ) . The 5 % and 10 % responders were 2 or 3 folds more in the rimonabant group ( 53.0 % vs. 20.0 % and 21.5 % vs. 5.7 % , resp . ) ( P < .0001 ) . Rimonabant also significantly increased HDL - cholesterol , decreased triglycerides and waist circumference , by 7.1 % , 10.6 % , and 2.8 cm , respectively ( P < .0001 ) . This study confirmed the comparable efficacy and safety profile of rimonabant in Asian population to Caucasians .

547,547,3536709_2,3536709,"TITLE : Low - protein vegetarian diet does not have a short - term effect on blood acid – base status but raises oxygen consumption during submaximal cycling ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Acid – base balance refers to the equilibrium between acids and bases in the human body . Nutrition may affect acid – base balance and further physical performance . With the help of PRAL ( potential renal acid load ) , a low - protein vegetarian diet ( LPVD ) was designed to enhance the production of bases in body . The aim of this study was to investigate if LPVD has an effect on blood acid – base status and performance during submaximal and maximal aerobic cycling . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Nine healthy , recreationally active men ( age 23.5 ± 3.4 yr ) participated in the study and were randomly divided into two groups in a cross - over study design . Group 1 followed LPVD for 4 days and group 2 ate normally ( ND ) before performing a cycle ergometer test . The test included three 10-min stages at 40 , 60 and 80 % of VO2max . The fourth stage was performed at 100 % of VO2max until exhaustion . After 10–16 days , the groups started a second 4-day diet , and at the end performed the similar ergometer test . Venous blood samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of both diet periods and after every stage cycled . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Diet caused no significant difference in venous blood pH , strong ion difference ( SID ) , total concentration of weak acids ( Atot ) , partial pressure of CO2 ( pCO2 ) or HCO3- at rest or during cycling between LPVD and ND . In the LPVD group , at rest SID significantly increased over the diet period ( 38.6 ± 1.8 vs. 39.8 ± 0.9 , p=0.009 ) . Diet had no significant effect on exercise time to exhaustion , but VO2 was significantly higher at 40 , 60 and 80 % of VO2max after LPVD compared to ND ( 2.03 ± 0.25 vs. 1.82 ± 0.21 l / min , p=0.035 ; 2.86 ± 0.36 vs. 2.52 ± 0.33 l / min , p<0.001 and 4.03 ± 0.50 vs. 3.54 ± 0.58 l / min , p<0.001 ; respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no difference in venous blood acid – base status between a 4-day LPVD and ND . VO2 was increased during submaximal cycling after LPVD suggesting that the exercise economy was poorer . This had no further effect on maximal aerobic performance .

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : In a majority of cases , whiplash injuries are a domain of conservative therapy . Nevertheless it remains unclear whether physical therapy is of medical or economic benefit in patients with whiplash injuries . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seventy patients with acute Quebec Task Force ( QTF ) grade II whiplash injuries were randomized to two therapy groups and received either active ( APT ) or passive ( PPT ) physical therapy . Patients were compared with regard to pain and range of motion with data obtained in an earlier study from a group with grade II whiplash injuries in which the therapy recommendation had been "" act as usual "" ( AAU ; n = 20 ) . The above - mentioned parameters were assessed at 24 hours and two months after the injury . Furthermore patients ' period of disability was documented after two months . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After two months , patients in both the APT and PPT groups showed significant improvement in the median period of disability ( active : 14 days ; passive : 14 days ) compared to the AAU group ( 49 days ) . No group difference was observed with regard to median improvement in range of motion ( active : 120 ° ; passive : 108 ° ; activity as usual : 70 ° ) . The median pain reduction was significantly greater in the APT group ( 50.5 ) than in the PPT ( 39.2 ) or AAU group ( 28.8 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Our data show that active physical therapy results in enhanced pain reduction and shortening of post - injury disability .

323,323,1693558_1,1693558,"TITLE : Low - frequency vibratory exercise reduces the risk of bone fracture more than walking : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Whole - body vibration ( WBV ) is a new type of exercise that has been increasingly tested for the ability to prevent bone fractures and osteoporosis in frail people . There are two currently marketed vibrating plates : a ) the whole plate oscillates up and down ; b ) reciprocating vertical displacements on the left and right side of a fulcrum , increasing the lateral accelerations . A few studies have shown recently the effectiveness of the up - and - down plate for increasing Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) and balance ; but the effectiveness of the reciprocating plate technique remains mainly unknown . The aim was to compare the effects of WBV using a reciprocating platform at frequencies lower than 20 Hz and a walking - based exercise programme on BMD and balance in post - menopausal women . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - eight physically untrained post - menopausal women were assigned at random to a WBV group or a Walking group . Both experimental programmes consisted of 3 sessions per week for 8 months . Each vibratory session included 6 bouts of 1 min ( 12.6 Hz in frequency and 3 cm in amplitude with 60 ° of knee flexion ) with 1 min rest between bouts . Each walking session was 55 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of stretching . Hip and lumbar BMD ( g·cm-2 ) were measured using dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry and balance was assessed by the blind flamingo test . ANOVA for repeated measurements was adjusted by baseline data , weight and age . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After 8 months , BMD at the femoral neck in the WBV group was increased by 4.3 % ( P = 0.011 ) compared to the Walking group . In contrast , the BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both groups . Balance was improved in the WBV group ( 29 % ) but not in the Walking group .

654,654,5040733_2,5040733,"TITLE : A post hoc analysis of dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant ( VKA ) therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism ( rVTE ) in patients with cancer and renal impairment ABSTRACT : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) is a common and serious complication in patients with cancer ; treatment guidelines recommend extended therapy of ≥6 months with low - molecular - weight heparin ( LMWH ) for treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE ( rVTE ) in this population . This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study — a phase III , randomized , open - label , controlled study ( N = 676)—to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin , a LMWH , versus vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) for prevention of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 60 ml / min ) . Overall , 162/676 ( 24 % ) patients had renal impairment at baseline . Patients received subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU / kg once daily during month 1 , followed by 150 IU / kg once daily for months 2–6 ; or VKA once daily for 6 months , with initial overlapping subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU / kg once daily for ≥5 days until international normalized ratio was 2.0–3.0 for 2 consecutive days . Endpoints included the rates of rVTE ( primary ) and bleeding events . Overall , fewer dalteparin - treated patients ( 2/74 [ 2.7 % ] ) experienced ≥1 adjudicated symptomatic rVTE compared with VKA - treated patients ( 15/88 [ 17.0 % ] ; hazard ratio = 0.15 [ 95 % confidence interval 0.03–0.65 ] ; p = 0.01 ) . Bleeding event rates for both treatments were similar ( p = 0.47 ) . In summary , compared with VKA , dalteparin significantly reduced risk of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( p = 0.01 ) while exhibiting a comparable safety profile . This analysis supports dosing patients with renal impairment in accordance with patients with normal renal function ; however , anti - Xa monitoring could be considered to further support safety in selected patients , particularly those with very severe renal impairment .",scaled attention,Dalteparin || Vitamin K antagonist || Any bleeding,"[(283, 296)]",2,test,attention
516,516,5483302_0,5483302,"TITLE : Effect of ezetimibe add - on therapy over 52 weeks extension analysis of prospective randomized trial ( RESEARCH study ) in type 2 diabetes subjects ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Lowering cholesterol levels decreases the risk of atherosclerotic diseases . Effective ways to stably reduce LDL - C level are warranted in type 2 diabetic patients , a high - risk population for CVD , with various anti - diabetic therapeutic background . The RESEARCH study focuses on LDL - C reduction in this population along with modifications of the lipid profiles . We evaluated long - term ezetimibe add - on therapy in T2DM patients with hypercholesterolemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , multicenter , open - label , prospective study , a total of 109 T2DM patients not attaining LDL - C target value despite first - line dose statin ( 10 mg of atorvastatin or 1 mg of pitavastatin ) therapy in Japan were recruited . We investigated the difference in cholesterol lowering effect between ezetimibe ( 10 mg ) add - on statin ( EAT ) group and double - dose statin ( DST ) group . Changes of parameters related to atherosclerotic event risks were assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The reduction of LDL - C was larger in the EAT group ( 28.3 % ) than in the DST group ( 9.2 % ) at 52 weeks as well as the primary endpoint of 12 weeks . EAT achieved significant lower levels of TC and apo B , respectively . Both treatments attained significant reduction in sd - LDL - C or hsCRP on this long - term basis . Notably , sd - LDL - C in EAT reduced as low as 36.1 ± 14.9 mg / dl to reach near the threshold ( 35.0 mg / dl ) for atherosclerosis with significantly higher achievement rate ( 55.6 % ) than DST treatment . Simultaneously , hsCRP reduction by EAT attained as low value as 0.52 ± 0.43 mg / l . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In the present 52-week long - term period , ezetimibe add - on therapy showed a robust advantage in lowering LDL - C and in attaining target LDL - C values compared with the doubling of statin dose . Moreover , it 's meaningful that sd - LDL , powerfully atherogenic lipoprotein , exhibited prominent decrease consistently prominently by ezetimibe add - on therapy . DM patients with hypercholesterolemia are at high risk for CAD , and adding ezetimibe onto usual - dose statin treatment in Japan has been suggested as the first - line therapy for those DM patients who failed to attain the target LDL - C value ( UMIN000002593 ) .",attention,ezetimibe (10 mg) add-on statin (EAT) || double-dose statin (DST) || Small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sd-LDL-C) level at 52wks,"[(204, 232)]",1,test,scaled attention
652,652,5040733_0,5040733,"TITLE : A post hoc analysis of dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant ( VKA ) therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism ( rVTE ) in patients with cancer and renal impairment ABSTRACT : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) is a common and serious complication in patients with cancer ; treatment guidelines recommend extended therapy of ≥6 months with low - molecular - weight heparin ( LMWH ) for treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE ( rVTE ) in this population . This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study — a phase III , randomized , open - label , controlled study ( N = 676)—to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin , a LMWH , versus vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) for prevention of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 60 ml / min ) . Overall , 162/676 ( 24 % ) patients had renal impairment at baseline . Patients received subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU / kg once daily during month 1 , followed by 150 IU / kg once daily for months 2–6 ; or VKA once daily for 6 months , with initial overlapping subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU / kg once daily for ≥5 days until international normalized ratio was 2.0–3.0 for 2 consecutive days . Endpoints included the rates of rVTE ( primary ) and bleeding events . Overall , fewer dalteparin - treated patients ( 2/74 [ 2.7 % ] ) experienced ≥1 adjudicated symptomatic rVTE compared with VKA - treated patients ( 15/88 [ 17.0 % ] ; hazard ratio = 0.15 [ 95 % confidence interval 0.03–0.65 ] ; p = 0.01 ) . Bleeding event rates for both treatments were similar ( p = 0.47 ) . In summary , compared with VKA , dalteparin significantly reduced risk of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( p = 0.01 ) while exhibiting a comparable safety profile . This analysis supports dosing patients with renal impairment in accordance with patients with normal renal function ; however , anti - Xa monitoring could be considered to further support safety in selected patients , particularly those with very severe renal impairment .",attention,Dalteparin || Vitamin K antagonist || ≥1 adjudicated symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism,"[(234, 282)]",1,test,lime

The aim of the present study was to determine if Omega-3 fatty acid could modulate immunological function and improve survival rate among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction . A total of 48 mechanically ventilated patients with intestinal dysfunction were included in this prospective , randomized and single - blind clinical study . Patients were randomly divided into control ( group A ) and treatment groups ( group B ) . The treatment protocol for all the participants followed the Sepsis Survival Campaign guidelines , and group B received total parenteral nutrition containing 100 ml of Omega-3 fatty acids ( containing 10 g refined fish oil ) per day in addition to the standard treatment applied in group A. Group B had a significantly lower mortality rate compared with group A ( 12.5 vs. 41.7 % , P<0.05 ) during the 28-day follow - up . Group B also had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores ( P<0.05 ) and lower Marshall scores ( P<0.05 ) at day 7 . In addition , group B had a higher ratio of T helper to inducer lymphocytes as well as a higher ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes ( P<0.01 for both ) than group A. It was concluded that Omega-3 fatty acids improved T helper / inducer and CD4 / CD8 ratios , and may have reduced mortality , among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction .",scaled attention,Total parenteral nutrition + Sepsis Survival Campaign guidelines || Sepsis Survival Campaign guidelines || T helper to inducer lymphocytes ratio,"[(230, 264)]",2,test,attention

Deepithelialized flaps have been used previously with the aim to eliminate shearing forces and the cone of pressure ( COP ) effect . The goal of this study is to adopt a standardized protocol and evaluate if 2 different flap techniques affect outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : The novel COP flap is illustrated . Twenty patients were prospectively treated with flap coverage over a 36-month period . According to the flap type , patients were assigned to 2 groups : group 1 with 11 patients treated with the COP flap and group 2 with 9 patients treated with conventional flap without anchoring technique . We adopted a standardized protocol of debridement , tissue cultures , and negative - pressure wound therapy . Rotation fasciocutaneous flaps were used for both groups and mean follow - up was 19 months . The COP flap is a large deepithelialized rotation flap inset with transcutaneous nonabsorbable bolster sutures . The 2 groups were comparable for demographics and ulcer location and size ( P < 0.05 ) . Five patients showed positive cultures and were treated with antibiotics and negative - pressure therapy before surgery . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Recurrence rates were 12 % in the COP flap group and 60 % in the conventional flap coverage group ( P < 0.001 ) . Results were compared at 16-month follow - up .

Stimulants are considered first - line pharmacological treatment and are the most prescribed treatment for ADHD . However , approximately 30 % of children with ADHD do not have an optimal response to a single stimulant and may require adjunctive therapy . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to conduct a cost - effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) of adding a non - stimulant , guanfacine extended release ( GXR ) , to stimulants versus maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness from a US third - party payer perspective . Effectiveness was measured by the QALY . The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states ( normal , mild , moderate and severe ) , defined by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI - S ) scale . Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient - level data from a multicentre , 9-week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - optimization study , where subjects ( n=461 ) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning , GXR administered in the evening , or placebo . The model assumed that patients in moderate / severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period . Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs , all in $ US , year 2010 values . Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks . Oneway sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis ( PSA ) were conducted by varying costs , utilities , adverse - event duration , and transition probabilities . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy , adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $ US1016 but a lower medical cost of $ US124 , resulting in a total incremental cost of $ US892 at 1 year . The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of $ US31 660 / QALY . In one - way sensitivity analysis , ICER values ranged from $ US19 723 , when 100 % of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state , to $ US46631 , when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period . PSA demonstrated a 94.6 % likelihood that the ICER falls below $ US50 000 / QALY . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized . This is the first analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive medication . This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with stimulants is a cost - effective treatment based on a willingness - to - pay threshold of $ US50 000 / QALY . This may address an unmet need among patients with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy .",attention,"Stimulant plus non-stimulant, guanfacine extended release (GXR) || Stimulant || drug cost","[(400, 424)]",1,test,attention

Alginate oligosaccharide ( AOS ) , a natural product , has antitumor activities and may have therapeutic effects in osteosarcoma , the molecular mechanisms of which remain unclear . AOS was prepared from alginate sodium using alginate lyase . The fractions of AOS were further isolated by size - exclusion chromatography and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI - MS ) . Osteosarcoma patients were enrolled in the study and assigned into two groups : AOS ( AG , oral administration of 10-mg AOS daily ) and control groups ( CG , placebo ) . Preoperative and postoperative clinical data were investigated and analyzed . Four different degrees of polymerizations ( DPs ) were isolated and denominated as DP2 , DP3 , DP4 , and DP5 . Among these polymers , only DP5 showed antitumor functions on osteosarcoma cells . Before surgery and the outcome of primary end point after surgery , no significant differences were observed for clinical data and tumor size between the AG and CG groups ( P > 0.05 ) . After 2-year therapy , the mean tumor volume was 214.6 ± 145.7 c.c . in AG and 467.2 ± 225.3 c.c in CG ( P < 0.01 ) . The rate of local recurrence was 44.9 and 68.7 % in AG and CG , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) .

However , it has been reported that dexmedetomidine decreases systemic blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output in a dose - dependent manner . The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine for sedation . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty - five American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I - II patients under spinal anesthesia received dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg intravenously as a loading dose . The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups for maintenance dose : Group A ( 0.25 μg / kg / hr ) , Group B ( 0.50 μg / kg / hr ) , and Group C ( 0.75 μg / kg / hr ) . The hemodynamic variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) score were recorded for all patients . The numbers of patients who developed hypotension , bradycardia , or inadequate sedation necessitating further drug treatment were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and SpO2 were decreased , and RSS score was increased significantly at both 20 min and 40 min after injection of dexmedetomidine in the three study groups compared to baseline , without significant differences between the groups . The prevalence of hypotension , but not that of bradycardia or adjunctive midazolam administration , exhibited a positive correlation with the dose of dexmedetomidine .

This clinical trial was conducted to study 195 women ( 132 in the control group and 63 in the experimental group ) who had attended healthcare centers in the city of Amol after their 16th gestational week . The experimental group participated in educational classes to learn how to experience a safe childbirth for 6 - 8 sessions of 1.5 hours almost every three weeks . The control group received only a routine care , pain assessment scales like Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and McGill questionnaire , and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) were employed to collect data . The data were analyzed using SPSS software through t - test and Chi Square test to compare the groups . The results of the t - test showed a meaningful difference in levels of stress felt by the experimental group compared to control group ( p=0.002 ) . The Visual Analogue Scale suggested that in the transitional stages ( 8 - 10 cm cervical dilation ) , the level of pain felt by the experimental group was meaningfully lower than that felt by the control group ( p=0.03 ) . However , this was not significantly different between the two groups at 3 - 4 cm cervical dilation and the second stage of childbirth . The McGill scale 's results for measuring pain levels , proved a meaningful difference between the experimental group and the control group ( p=0.018 ) . Educational and supportive interventions increased mothers ' knowledge during pregnancy and reduced their fear of unknown environment and people . These trained women learned how to effectively overcome their problems and labor pain .",others,Prenatal education || Control || McGill scale's pain,"[(271, 297)]",0,test,deeplift

Although first biopsy result was benign , repeat biopsy is recommended for the patient who has higher risk of prostate cancer . In this study , we investigated the PSA change ratio ( post - biopsy PSA to baseline PSA ) whether it could be predictive factor of prostate cancer and helpful when decided to perform repeat biopsy . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : 151 patients , first diagnosed as benign , but underwent repeat biopsy due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer were included . Post - biopsy PSA was checked 60 minutes later after biopsy . PSA change ratio was defined as post - biopsy PSA to baseline PSA . According to results of repeat biopsy , patients were divided into benign group ( group A ) and cancer groups ( group B ) . Between two group baseline PSA , PSA density , post - biopsy PSA and PSA change ratio were compared , and most effective cut - off value was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 129 men were benign , 22 men were prostate cancer according to results of repeat biopsy . Between two groups , post - biopsy PSA and PSA change ratio were statically significant differences . ( p<0.001 , < 0.001 ) The effective cut - off value was 3.0 , 3.5 and 4.0 according to ROC . At ROC curve , PSA change ratio was statistically significant for diagnosis of prostate cancer . ( AUC 0.800 , p<0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : PSA change ratio is thought be a predictive factor for prostate cancer . If the PSA change ratio was less than 3.0 - 4.0 , repeat biopsy should be considered to confirm the diagnosis .",attention,Prostate cancer || Benign result || PSA,"[(228, 251)]",1,test,attention

Consequently , the combination of formoterol and budesonide in one inhaler , approved for maintenance use , can potentially be used for reliever therapy . This study compared the onset of relief from induced bronchospasm with a single dose of budesonide / formoterol versus standard salbutamol therapy in patients with asthma . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In this randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study , 32 patients with asthma underwent a methacholine provocation test leading to a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) of ≥30 % at enrolment ( Visit 1 ) and three subsequent study visits ( Visits 2–4 ) . Immediately after each provocation at Visits 2–4 , patients received one of three test treatments : one inhalation of budesonide / formoterol 160/4.5 μg ( via Turbuhaler ® ) , two inhalations of salbutamol 100 μg ( via a pressurised metered - dose inhaler [ pMDI ] ) or placebo . All patients received each of the test treatments in a randomised order , after separate methacholine provocations . The effect of treatment on FEV1 and breathlessness ( using the Borg scale ) was measured at 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 and 30 minutes after test treatment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Following methacholine provocation , Borg score increased from a baseline value of below 0.5 to 3.03 , 3.31 and 3.50 before treatment with budesonide / formoterol , salbutamol and placebo , respectively . Budesonide / formoterol and salbutamol reversed methacholine - induced dyspnoea ( breathlessness ) rapidly . At 1 minute after inhalation , statistically significant decreases in Borg score were observed for budesonide / formoterol and salbutamol ( p = 0.0233 and p < 0.0001 , respectively , versus placebo ) , with similar rapid increases in FEV1 ( both active treatments p < 0.0001 versus placebo ) . The median time to 50 % recovery in Borg score after methacholine provocation was 3 minutes with budesonide / formoterol , 2 minutes with salbutamol and 10 minutes with placebo . All treatments and procedures were well tolerated . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Single doses of budesonide / formoterol and salbutamol both provided rapid relief of dyspnoea and reversal of severe airway obstruction in patients with asthma with experimentally induced bronchoconstriction . The perception of relief , as confirmed by objective lung function assessment , provides evidence that budesonide / formoterol can be used as reliever medication in asthma .",scaled attention,budesonide/formoterol and salbutamol || placebo || Forced expiratory volume (FEV1),"[(324, 376)]",2,test,lime

This study assessed these effects of rimonabant in Asian population . A total of 643 patients ( BMI 25 kg / m2 or greater without diabetes ) from China , Republic of Korea , and Taiwan were prescribed a hypocaloric diet ( 600 kcal / day deficit ) and randomized to rimonabant 20 mg ( n = 318 ) or placebo ( n = 325 ) for 9months . The primary efficacy variable was weight change from baseline after 9 months of treatment . Results showed that rimonabant group lost more weight than placebo , ( LSM ± SEM of −4.7 ± 0.3 kg vs. −1.7 ± 0.3 kg , P < .0001 ) . The 5 % and 10 % responders were 2 or 3 folds more in the rimonabant group ( 53.0 % vs. 20.0 % and 21.5 % vs. 5.7 % , resp . ) ( P < .0001 ) . Rimonabant also significantly increased HDL - cholesterol , decreased triglycerides and waist circumference , by 7.1 % , 10.6 % , and 2.8 cm , respectively ( P < .0001 ) . This study confirmed the comparable efficacy and safety profile of rimonabant in Asian population to Caucasians .

We compared appendiceal diverticulitis with acute appendicitis to study the clinical characteristics of appendiceal diverticulitis . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Among 1,029 patients who received appendectomy from January 2009 to May 2011 , 38 patients with appendiceal diverticulitis ( diverticulitis group ) were compared with 98 randomly collected patients with acute appendicitis ( appendicitis group ) during the same period . Patients ' characteristics , clinical features , laboratory findings , operative findings , and postoperative course were compared between the two groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Thirty - eight patients ( 3.7 % ) were pathologically diagnosed with acute appendiceal diverticulitis among 1,029 cases of appendectomy . The mean age of patients in the diverticulitis group was significantly older than that of the appendicitis group ( 49.0 ± 15.2 years vs. 25.4 ± 14.2 years , P < 0.05 ) . Mean duration of preoperative symptoms was longer in the diverticulitis group ( 3.6 ± 3.8 days vs. 1.8 ± 3.2 days , P < 0.05 ) . The site of abdominal pain , fever , signs of localized peritonitis , accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms , and white blood cell count showed no differences between the two groups .

217,217,4162719_0,4162719,"TITLE : Performance Accuracy of Hand - on - needle versus Hand - on - syringe Technique for Ultrasound - guided Regional Anesthesia Simulation for Emergency Medicine Residents ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Ultrasound - guided nerve blocks ( UGNB ) are increasingly used in emergency care . The hand - on - syringe ( HS ) needle technique is ideally suited to the emergency department setting because it allows a single operator to perform the block without assistance . The HS technique is assumed to provide less exact needle control than the alternative two - operator hand - on - needle ( HN ) technique ; however this assumption has never been directly tested . The primary objective of this study was to compare accuracy of needle targeting under ultrasound guidance by emergency medicine ( EM ) residents using HN and HS techniques on a standardized gelatinous simulation model . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This prospective , randomized study evaluated task performance . We compared needle targeting accuracy using the HN and HS techniques . Each participant performed a set of structured needling maneuvers ( both simple and difficult ) on a standardized partial - task simulator . We evaluated time to task completion , needle visualization during advancement , and accuracy of needle tip at targeting . Resident technique preference was assessed using a post - task survey . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We evaluated 60 tasks performed by 10 EM residents . There was no significant difference in time to complete the simple model ( HN vs. HS , 18 seconds vs. 18 seconds , p=0.93 ) , time to complete the difficult model ( HN vs. HS , 56 seconds vs. 50 seconds , p=0.63 ) , needle visualization , or needle tip targeting accuracy . Most residents ( 60 % ) preferred the HS technique . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : For EM residents learning UGNBs , the HN technique was not associated with superior needle control . Our results suggest that the single - operator HS technique provides equivalent needle control when compared to the two - operator HN technique .",scaled attention,single operator hand-on-syringe (HS) needle technique || two-operator hand-on-needle (HN) technique || time to complete the difficult model,"[(264, 283)]",2,test,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A post hoc analysis of a phase 3 trial assessing micafungin ( 100 mg / day for subjects > 40 kg ; 2 mg / kg / day for subjects ≤ 40 kg ) versus liposomal amphotericin B ( 3 mg / kg / day ) . Subgroups were defined according to the type of ward on the first day of treatment : intensive care unit ( ICU ) or non - ICU . Multivariate regression was performed to identify factors associated with treatment success at end of therapy and all - cause mortality at days 8 and 30 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In non - ICU subjects , treatment success was significantly higher for micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B ( 85 % ( n = 108/127 ) versus 72.1 % ( n = 98/136 ) ; P = 0.0113 ) . However , for ICU subjects , treatment success rates for micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B were similar ( 62.5 % ( n = 75/120 ) versus 66.4 % ( n = 73/110 ) ; P = 0.5828 ) . Overall , treatment success was significantly lower in ICU subjects compared with non - ICU subjects ( 64.3 % ( n = 148/230 ) versus 78.3 % ( n = 206/263 ) ; P = 0.0006 ) . Multivariate regression analysis revealed a lower likelihood of treatment success for : ICU versus non - ICU subjects ; persistent neutropenia ; and high versus low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II scores . However , when interactions between potential explanatory factors were included in the analysis model , ICU status no longer emerged as a significant associated variable but the association between APACHE II score and treatment outcome remained . Further analyses indicated that the likelihood of mortality at day 8 and day 30 was lower for subjects with lower APACHE II scores . Renal function was significantly better in micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B subjects : a difference ( liposomal amphotericin B - micafungin in mean peak change in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( ml / minute/1.73 m2 ) of -18.2 ( P < 0.0001 ) and -17.7 ( P = 0.0124 ) in non - ICU and ICU subjects , respectively . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Overall , ICU subjects had lower treatment success rates than non - ICU subjects for both liposomal amphotericin B and micafungin . Multivariate regression after controlling for potential confounding factors suggested the APACHE II score remained a potential explanatory factor associated with treatment success , mortality at day 8 , and mortality at day 30 .

197,197,4076224_0,4076224,"TITLE : A Comparison of Screening Methods for Sleep Disorders in Australian Community Pharmacies : A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Community pharmacies may potentially assist in screening for chronic conditions such as sleep disorders , which remain both under - diagnosed and untreated . We aimed to compare a subjective risk - assessment - only questionnaire ( RAO ) for common sleep disorder screening against the same risk - assessment questionnaire plus a nasal flow monitor as an objective marker of possible underlying obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ( RA+ ) in a community pharmacy setting . The primary outcome was the number of participants identified in RAO or RA+ group who were likely to have and consequently be diagnosed with OSA . Further outcomes included the number of participants identified as being at risk for , referred for , taking - up referral for , and then diagnosed with OSA , insomnia , and/or restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) in either group . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a cluster - randomized trial , participants were recruited through 23 community pharmacies . Using validated instruments , 325 ( RAO = 152 , RA+ = 173 ) participants were screened for OSA , insomnia , and RLS . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : 218 ( 67 % ) participants were at risk of OSA , insomnia or RLS and these participants were referred to their primary physician . The proportion of screened participants identified as being at risk of OSA was significantly higher in the RA+ group ( 36 % in RAO vs. 66 % in RA+ , OR 3.4 , 95 % CI ( 1.8–6.5 ) , p<0.001 ) . A 12-month follow - up was completed in 125 RAO and 155 RA+ participants . Actual referral uptake was 34 % RAO , 26 % RA+ , OR 4.4 , 95 % CI ( 1.4–19.2 ) , p = 0.31 . The OSA diagnosis rate was higher in the RA+ arm ( p = 0.01 ) . To yield a single additional confirmed OSA diagnosis , 16 people would need to be screened using the RA+ protocol . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that utilising either screening method is feasible in identifying individuals in the community pharmacy setting who are likely to have OSA , insomnia and/or RLS . Secondly , adding an objective marker of OSA to a questionnaire - based prediction tool resulted in more confirmed OSA diagnoses .

However , there is evidence gap regarding the breakup , timing and type of the steroid regimen . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : : Efficacy of three different glucocorticoid regimens having the same total dose of steroid , differing in either the timing or type of evening steroid administered , in achieving biochemical control of the disease was assessed . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The study was done in 13 prepubertal children with classical CAH over a 6-month period with 2 months devoted to each regimen . We used a prospective cross - over design using 10 - 15 mg / m2 total dose of hydrocortisone . Two - fifths of the total dose of hydrocortisone was administered in the morning and one - fifth of the total dose was administered at noon in all the regimens . The regimens differed in the timing of the evening dose of hydrocortisone , 06.00 - 07.00 pm in regimen 1 and 09.00 - 10.00 pm in regimen 2 .

However , it has been reported that dexmedetomidine decreases systemic blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output in a dose - dependent manner . The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine for sedation . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty - five American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I - II patients under spinal anesthesia received dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg intravenously as a loading dose . The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups for maintenance dose : Group A ( 0.25 μg / kg / hr ) , Group B ( 0.50 μg / kg / hr ) , and Group C ( 0.75 μg / kg / hr ) . The hemodynamic variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) score were recorded for all patients . The numbers of patients who developed hypotension , bradycardia , or inadequate sedation necessitating further drug treatment were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and SpO2 were decreased , and RSS score was increased significantly at both 20 min and 40 min after injection of dexmedetomidine in the three study groups compared to baseline , without significant differences between the groups . The prevalence of hypotension , but not that of bradycardia or adjunctive midazolam administration , exhibited a positive correlation with the dose of dexmedetomidine . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg followed by continuous administration at infusion rates of 0.25 , 0.50 , or 0.75 μg / kg / hr produced adequate levels of sedation . However , there was a tendency for the incidence of hypotension to increase as the dose increased . To minimize the risk of hemodynamic instability , a dose of 0.25 μg / kg / hr may be the most appropriate for continuous administration of dexmedetomidine .",scaled attention,Dexmedetomidine 0.25 μg/kg/hr || Dexmedetomidine 0.75 μg/kg/hr || Heart rate,"[(187, 232)]",2,test,attention
109,109,5541727_5,5541727,"TITLE : Safety , tolerability , clinical , and joint structural outcomes of a single intra - articular injection of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells in patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction : a controlled double - blind randomised trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Few clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for the management of post - traumatic osteoarthritis . The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of a single intra - articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells ( MPCs ) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In this phase Ib / IIa , double - blind , active comparator clinical study , 17 patients aged 18–40 years with unilateral ACL reconstruction were randomized ( 2:1 ) to receive either a single intra - articular injection of 75 million allogeneic MPCs suspended in hyaluronan ( HA ) ( MPC + HA group ) ( n = 11 ) or HA alone ( n = 6 ) . Patients were monitored for adverse events . Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti - HLA panel reactive antibodies ( PRA ) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry . Pain , function , and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) and SF-36v2 scores . Joint space width was measured from radiographs , and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + HA group and 0 out of 6 HA controls . No cell - related serious adverse effects were observed . Increases in class I PRA > 10 % were observed at week 4 in the MPC + HA group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104 . Compared with the HA group , MPC + HA - treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain , symptom , activities of daily living , and SF-36 bodily pain scores ( p < 0.05 ) . The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing ( p < 0.05 ) , less tibial bone expansion ( 0.5 % vs 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.02 ) , and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss ( 0.7 % vs – 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.10 ) than the HA controls . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intra - articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following ACL reconstruction was safe , well tolerated , and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes . These findings suggest that MPCs warrant further investigations as they may modulate some of the pathological processes responsible for the development of post - traumatic osteoarthritis following ACL reconstruction .

ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : In a majority of cases , whiplash injuries are a domain of conservative therapy . Nevertheless it remains unclear whether physical therapy is of medical or economic benefit in patients with whiplash injuries . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seventy patients with acute Quebec Task Force ( QTF ) grade II whiplash injuries were randomized to two therapy groups and received either active ( APT ) or passive ( PPT ) physical therapy . Patients were compared with regard to pain and range of motion with data obtained in an earlier study from a group with grade II whiplash injuries in which the therapy recommendation had been "" act as usual "" ( AAU ; n = 20 ) . The above - mentioned parameters were assessed at 24 hours and two months after the injury . Furthermore patients ' period of disability was documented after two months . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After two months , patients in both the APT and PPT groups showed significant improvement in the median period of disability ( active : 14 days ; passive : 14 days ) compared to the AAU group ( 49 days ) . No group difference was observed with regard to median improvement in range of motion ( active : 120 ° ; passive : 108 ° ; activity as usual : 70 ° ) . The median pain reduction was significantly greater in the APT group ( 50.5 ) than in the PPT ( 39.2 ) or AAU group ( 28.8 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Our data show that active physical therapy results in enhanced pain reduction and shortening of post - injury disability . Therefore , active physical therapy should be considered the treatment of choice in patients with QTF grade II whiplash injuries .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was a randomized , two - period crossover open - label study in symptomatic patients with COPD [ age 40 years or older , postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) of 70 % or less and 50 % or more of predicted normal values , and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score of 2 or greater ] not receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy . Patients were randomized to receive UMEC / VI ( 62.5/25 μg once daily ) via a multidose dry powder inhaler ( ELLIPTA ) followed by TIO / OLO ( 5/5 μg once daily ) via a soft mist inhaler ( Respimat ) , each for 8 weeks with an interim 3-week washout or vice versa . The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 with a noninferiority margin of − 50 mL in the per - protocol ( PP ) population . The incidence of adverse events was also assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In total , 236 patients ( mean age 64.4 years , 60 % male ) were included in the intent - to - treat population and 227 were included in the PP population . UMEC / VI treatment was noninferior in the PP population and superior in the intent - to - treat population to TIO / OLO treatment with regard to trough FEV1 at week 8 [ FEV1 change from baseline 180 mL vs 128 mL ; difference 52 mL ( 95 % confidence interval 28–77 mL ) ; p < 0.001 ] . Patients receiving UMEC / VI had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase ( 100 mL or more ) from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 compared with patients receiving TIO / OLO ( odds ratio 2.05 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.34–3.14 ) . Adverse events occurred in 25 % of patients in the UMEC / VI group and in 31 % of patients in the TIO / OLO group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : In this first direct comparison of two once - daily fixed - dose LAMA / LABA combinations , superiority was observed for the primary end point of trough FEV1 at week 8 with UMEC / VI compared with TIO / OLO in patients with symptomatic COPD . Both treatments had similar safety profiles . These findings confirm the results of previous indirect LAMA / LABA comparisons , and show that an efficacy gradient exists within the LAMA / LABA class .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled in this prospective , randomized , double - blind study . Four types of medications were applied in their nostrils with binary combinations of spray bottles on four different days in a random order : placebo ( normal saline [ NS]+NS ) , decongestant ( NS+oxymetazoline ) , anesthetic ( NS+lidocaine ) , and decongestant plus anesthetic ( oxymetazoline+lidocaine ) . Rigid nasal endoscopy was performed 10 minutes after spray application . The volunteers evaluated the discomfort caused by each spray application , and nasal pain scores due to the passage of the endoscope . The physicians quantified nasal decongestion using a visual analogue scale . Endoscopy duration as well as pulse and mean blood pressure ( MBP ) before spray application , 10 minutes after the application , and immediately after endoscopic examination were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The discomfort caused by lidocaine was significantly higher than that caused by the other sprays ( P<0.001 ) . The lowest pain score related to endoscopy was obtained for oxymetazoline+lidocaine ( P<0.001 ) . Nasal decongestion was best achieved with NS+oxymetazoline ( P<0.001 ) . Endoscopy duration was the shortest for oxymetazoline+ lidocaine ( P<0.05 ) . Statistically significant MBP changes were only seen with the application of NS+oxymetazoline ( P<0.05 ) .

We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single - session of group hypnotherapy for smoking cessation compared to relaxation in Swiss adult smokers . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was a cluster - randomised , parallel - group , controlled trial . A single session of hypnosis or relaxation for smoking cessation was delivered to groups of smokers ( median size = 11 ) . Participants were 223 smokers consuming ≥ 5 cigarettes per day , willing to quit and not using cessation aids ( 47.1 % females , M = 37.5 years [ SD = 11.8 ] , 86.1 % Swiss ) . Nicotine withdrawal , smoking abstinence self - efficacy , and adverse reactions were assessed at a 2-week follow - up . The main outcome , self - reported 30-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence , was assessed at a 6-month follow up . Abstinence was validated through salivary analysis . Secondary outcomes included number of cigarettes smoked per day , smoking abstinence self - efficacy , and nicotine withdrawal . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At the 6-month follow up , 14.7 % in the hypnosis group and 17.8 % in the relaxation group were abstinent . The intervention had no effect on smoking status ( p = .73 ) or on the number of cigarettes smoked per day ( p = .56 ) .

Its prevalence increases with age and duration of diabetes . It is more common in patients who have suboptimal glycemic control over several years . Because DPN may be resistant to conventional treatments , it is common for patients to only have partial pain relief . Therefore , new therapeutic options are needed for the condition . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : : The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) and pulsed radiofrequency ( PRF ) lumbar sympathectomy in treating painful DPN . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : : Sixty - five patients with painful DPN refractory to conventional treatment were randomly and evenly assigned to either the TENS or PRF lumbar sympathectomy groups . Pain evaluations were based on the 10-point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . Subjects were followed for three months and had a total of four study visits ( baseline and 1 week , 1 month , and 3 months after treatment ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Sixty patients completed all study visits . In both groups , the NRS rating significantly decreased after treatment , with a marked pain reduction observed at the first follow - up evaluation . In the PRF group , the NRS decreased from 6.46 at baseline to 2.76 at the 1 week visit . One and 3 months after treatment , the NRS was 4.30 and 5.13 , respectively ( P < 0.0001 ) . In the TENS group , the NRS decreased from 6.10 at baseline to 3.96 at the 1 week visit . One and 3 months after treatment , the NRS was 5.23 and 5.90 , respectively ( P < 0.0001 ) . Unfortunately , the NRS steady increased almost back to baseline levels in the TENS group . The NRS only slightly increased during the follow - up period in the PRF group , but did not reach baseline levels .

Internet - based cognitive behavior therapy ( ICBT ) is a treatment option supported in several trials , but there is as yet a lack of effective studies of ICBT in "" real world "" primary care settings . We examined whether ICBT differed from treatment - as - usual ( TAU ) in reducing depressive symptoms after 3 months . TAU comprised of visits to general practitioner , registered nurse , antidepressant drugs , waiting list for , or psychotherapy , or combinations of these alternatives . Patients , aged ≥ 18 years , who tentatively met criteria for mild to moderate depression at 16 primary care centers in the south - western region of Sweden were recruited and then assessed in a diagnostic interview . A total of 90 patients were randomized to either TAU or ICBT . The ICBT treatment included interactive elements online , a workbook , a CD with mindfulness and acceptance exercises , and minimal therapist contact . The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks after which both groups were assessed . The main outcome measure was Beck Depression Inventory - II ( BDI - II ) . Additional measures were Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale – self rating version ( MADRS - S ) and Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) . The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups at post treatment , neither on BDI - II , MADRS - S , nor BAI .

There are two currently marketed vibrating plates : a ) the whole plate oscillates up and down ; b ) reciprocating vertical displacements on the left and right side of a fulcrum , increasing the lateral accelerations . A few studies have shown recently the effectiveness of the up - and - down plate for increasing Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) and balance ; but the effectiveness of the reciprocating plate technique remains mainly unknown . The aim was to compare the effects of WBV using a reciprocating platform at frequencies lower than 20 Hz and a walking - based exercise programme on BMD and balance in post - menopausal women . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - eight physically untrained post - menopausal women were assigned at random to a WBV group or a Walking group . Both experimental programmes consisted of 3 sessions per week for 8 months . Each vibratory session included 6 bouts of 1 min ( 12.6 Hz in frequency and 3 cm in amplitude with 60 ° of knee flexion ) with 1 min rest between bouts . Each walking session was 55 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of stretching . Hip and lumbar BMD ( g·cm-2 ) were measured using dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry and balance was assessed by the blind flamingo test . ANOVA for repeated measurements was adjusted by baseline data , weight and age . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After 8 months , BMD at the femoral neck in the WBV group was increased by 4.3 % ( P = 0.011 ) compared to the Walking group . In contrast , the BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both groups . Balance was improved in the WBV group ( 29 % ) but not in the Walking group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The 8-month course of vibratory exercise using a reciprocating plate is feasible and is more effective than walking to improve two major determinants of bone fractures : hip BMD and balance .",attention,Whole-body vibration || Walking || Bone Mineral Density at the lumbar spine,"[(323, 338)]",1,test,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twelve adult male ( 27.3 ± 1.0 yr , 178.6 ± 1.4 cm , 78.0 ± 2.5 kg , 8.9 ± 1.1 % fat ) endurance - trained ( 53.3 ± 2.0 ml * kg-1 * min-1 , cycling ~160 km / wk ) cyclists completed a simulated road race on a cycle ergometer ( Lode ) , consisting of a two - hour cycling bout at 60 % of peak aerobic capacity ( VO2peak ) with three 10-second sprints performed at 110 % VO2 peak every 15 minutes . Cyclists completed the 2-hr cycling bout before and after dietary creatine monohydrate or placebo supplementation ( 3 g / day for 28 days ) . Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and five minutes before the end of the two - hour ride . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There was a 24.5 ± 10.0 % increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 ± 23.9 % increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group ( P < 0.05 ) . Plasma glucose , blood lactate , and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride , as well as VO2 peak , were not affected by creatine supplementation . Submaximal oxygen consumption near the end of the two - hour ride was decreased by approximately 10 % by creatine supplementation ( P < 0.05 ) . Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post - supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group ( +14.0 ± 6.3 % ) than the placebo group ( -10.4 ± 4.4 % ; P < 0.05 ) at 90 minutes of exercise .

However , it has been reported that dexmedetomidine decreases systemic blood pressure , heart rate , and cardiac output in a dose - dependent manner . The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine for sedation . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty - five American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I - II patients under spinal anesthesia received dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg intravenously as a loading dose . The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups for maintenance dose : Group A ( 0.25 μg / kg / hr ) , Group B ( 0.50 μg / kg / hr ) , and Group C ( 0.75 μg / kg / hr ) . The hemodynamic variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) score were recorded for all patients . The numbers of patients who developed hypotension , bradycardia , or inadequate sedation necessitating further drug treatment were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and SpO2 were decreased , and RSS score was increased significantly at both 20 min and 40 min after injection of dexmedetomidine in the three study groups compared to baseline , without significant differences between the groups . The prevalence of hypotension , but not that of bradycardia or adjunctive midazolam administration , exhibited a positive correlation with the dose of dexmedetomidine . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine 1 μg / kg followed by continuous administration at infusion rates of 0.25 , 0.50 , or 0.75 μg / kg / hr produced adequate levels of sedation .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twelve adult male ( 27.3 ± 1.0 yr , 178.6 ± 1.4 cm , 78.0 ± 2.5 kg , 8.9 ± 1.1 % fat ) endurance - trained ( 53.3 ± 2.0 ml * kg-1 * min-1 , cycling ~160 km / wk ) cyclists completed a simulated road race on a cycle ergometer ( Lode ) , consisting of a two - hour cycling bout at 60 % of peak aerobic capacity ( VO2peak ) with three 10-second sprints performed at 110 % VO2 peak every 15 minutes . Cyclists completed the 2-hr cycling bout before and after dietary creatine monohydrate or placebo supplementation ( 3 g / day for 28 days ) . Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and five minutes before the end of the two - hour ride . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There was a 24.5 ± 10.0 % increase in resting muscle total creatine and 38.4 ± 23.9 % increase in muscle creatine phosphate in the creatine group ( P < 0.05 ) . Plasma glucose , blood lactate , and respiratory exchange ratio during the 2-hour ride , as well as VO2 peak , were not affected by creatine supplementation . Submaximal oxygen consumption near the end of the two - hour ride was decreased by approximately 10 % by creatine supplementation ( P < 0.05 ) . Changes in plasma volume from pre- to post - supplementation were significantly greater in the creatine group ( +14.0 ± 6.3 % ) than the placebo group ( -10.4 ± 4.4 % ; P < 0.05 ) at 90 minutes of exercise .

This study aimed to examine the efficacy of 4 % lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine compared to 2 % lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine as inferior alveolar nerve block for the removal of an impacted lower third molar . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This single - blind study involved 31 healthy patients ( mean age : 23 y ; range : 19 - 33 y ) with symmetrically impacted lower third molars as observed on panoramic radiographs . Volunteers required 2 surgical interventions by the same surgeon with a 3-week washout period . The volunteers were assigned either 4 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine or 2 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as local anesthetic during each operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We recorded the time of administration , need for additional anesthetic administration , total volume of anesthetic used . We found that the patient 's preference for either of the 2 types of local anesthetic were significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) . However , the extent of pulpal anesthesia , surgical duration , and duration of soft tissue anesthesia were not significantly different . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggested that inferior alveolar nerve block using 4 % lidocaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine as a local anesthetic was clinically more effective than that using 2 % lidocaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine ; the surgical duration was not affected , and no clinically adverse effects were encountered .",attention,"4% lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine || 2% lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine || the duration of anesthesia","[(207, 229)]",1,test,scaled attention

The success of virtual environments likely depends on whether a sense of presence can be established , where participants become fully immersed in the virtual environment . Exposure to virtual environments is associated with physiological responses , including cortical activation changes . Whether the addition of a real exercise within a virtual environment alters sense of presence perception , or the accompanying physiological changes , is not known . In a randomized and controlled study design , moderate - intensity Exercise ( i.e. , self - paced cycling ) and No - Exercise ( i.e. , automatic propulsion ) trials were performed within three levels of virtual environment exposure . Each trial was 5 minutes in duration and was followed by posttrial assessments of heart rate , perceived sense of presence , EEG , and mental state . Changes in psychological strain and physical state were generally mirrored by neural activation patterns . Furthermore , these changes indicated that exercise augments the demands of virtual environment exposures and this likely contributed to an enhanced sense of presence .",attention,Exercise of moderate intensity || No exercise || Sense of presence in virtual immersive environment,"[(199, 223)]",1,test,attention

At the moment , however , there are no data suggesting the better control of once - daily fixed ( Fixed ) over free doses in separate administrations combination therapy in hypertensives . In a population of 39 consecutive outpatient patients referred to the departmental Hypertension clinic of the University Hospital of Salerno Medical School with the first diagnosis of arterial hypertension , we tested the hypothesis that the Fixed achieve a better control of blood pressure than the Free combination . Patients were randomized to either strategy and after 3 months patients underwent a clinical assessment to evaluate the antihypertensive effect . The two groups , matched for anthropometric and clinical parameters , received Amlodipine ( 5–10 mg / daily ) and Perindopril ( 5–10 mg / daily ) . Perindopril and Amlodipine doses did not significantly differ between the two groups . After 3 months BP control was improved in both groups and BP targets were similarly reached in both groups ( SBP ; Fixed : 61.54 % ; Free 69.23 % ; n.s .

The reduction in systolic blood pressure was similar in both groups ( Fixed:7.64±2.49 % ; Free : 7.81±4.00 % , n.s . ) , while the reduction of diastolic blood pressure was greater in the Fixed group ( Fixed : 14.22±2.03 % ; Free : 4.92±5.00 % , p<0.05 ) . Although both strategies are effective in reducing BP , the use of Fixed dose has an advantage in the reduction of BP . The present study does not allow to identify the mechanisms of this difference , which can be assumed to be due to the pharmacokinetics of the drugs administered in once - daily fixed combination .",others,ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist fixed dose || ACE-I + Calcium Antagonist free dose || Diastolic blood pressure reduction,"[(263, 290)]",0,test,scaled attention

Little is known about effective interventions and strategies for improving the eHealth literacy of the older population . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a theory - driven eHealth literacy intervention for older adults . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The experimental design was a 2 × 2 mixed factorial design with learning method ( collaborative ; individualistic ) as the between - participants variable and time of measurement ( pre ; post ) as the within - participants variable . A total of 146 older adults aged 56–91 ( mean 69.99 , SD 8.12 ) participated in this study during February to May 2011 . The intervention involved 2 weeks of learning about using the National Institutes of Health 's SeniorHealth.gov website to access reliable health information . The intervention took place at public libraries . Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental condition ( collaborative : n = 72 ; individualistic : n = 74 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Overall , participants ' knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy all improved significantly from pre to post intervention ( P < .001 in all cases ; effect sizes were > 0.8 with statistical power of 1.00 even at the .01 level in all cases ) . When controlling for baseline differences , no significant main effect of the learning method was found on computer / Web knowledge , skills , or eHealth literacy efficacy . Thus , collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes . No significant interaction effect of learning method and time of measurement was found . Group composition based on gender , familiarity with peers , or prior computer experience had no significant main or interaction effect on the learning outcomes . Regardless of the specific learning method used , participants had overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward the intervention and reported positive changes in participation in their own health care as a result of the intervention . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The findings provide strong evidence that the eHealth literacy intervention tested in this study , regardless of the specific learning method used , significantly improved knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy from pre to post intervention , was positively perceived by participants , and led to positive changes in their own health care . Collaborative learning did not differ from individualistic learning in affecting the learning outcomes , suggesting the previously widely reported advantages of collaborative over individualistic learning may not be easily applied to the older population in informal settings , though several confounding factors might have contributed to this finding ( ie , the largely inexperienced computer user composition of the study sample , potential instructor effect , and ceiling effect ) .

459,459,4336131_4,4336131,"TITLE : Effects of Rikkunshito ( traditional Japanese medicine ) on enteral feeding and the plasma ghrelin level in critically ill patients : a pilot study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Rikkunshito is a traditional Japanese medicine that has been widely prescribed for patients with various gastrointestinal symptoms . Recently , the prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito in patients with a variety of diseases have attracted attention in Japan . The prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito are believed to result from an increase of active ghrelin , which is most abundant in the stomach and which has a gastrokinetic function . The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effects of Rikkunshito on intragastric enteral feeding and plasma ghrelin levels in critically ill patients . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The study population consisted of critically ill patients who were projected to require intragastric tube feeding for more than 7 days . The patients were prospectively assigned to one of two treatment groups and were randomized to receive either Rikkunshito ( 2.5 g ) or metoclopramide ( 10 mg ) every 8 h. All patients received standard enteral nutrition . Patients in both groups were begun on intragastric tube feeding according to our institution 's feeding protocol . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : All patients were undergoing mechanical ventilation at the time of enrollment . The portions of enteral nutrition provided to the target amount and the quantity of gastric discharge were not statistically significantly different between the two groups . The Rikkunshito group reached 50 % of the target amount of enteral feeding significantly earlier than the metoclopramide group , although the proportion of patients in whom enteral feeding was successful did not differ significantly between the two groups . Patients in the Rikkunshito group showed significantly higher plasma levels of active ghrelin compared to those in the metoclopramide group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The administration of Rikkunshito increased the plasma level of active ghrelin , and induced prokinetic effects that were greater than those observed following treatment with metoclopramide in critically ill patients .

We compared appendiceal diverticulitis with acute appendicitis to study the clinical characteristics of appendiceal diverticulitis . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Among 1,029 patients who received appendectomy from January 2009 to May 2011 , 38 patients with appendiceal diverticulitis ( diverticulitis group ) were compared with 98 randomly collected patients with acute appendicitis ( appendicitis group ) during the same period . Patients ' characteristics , clinical features , laboratory findings , operative findings , and postoperative course were compared between the two groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Thirty - eight patients ( 3.7 % ) were pathologically diagnosed with acute appendiceal diverticulitis among 1,029 cases of appendectomy . The mean age of patients in the diverticulitis group was significantly older than that of the appendicitis group ( 49.0 ± 15.2 years vs. 25.4 ± 14.2 years , P < 0.05 ) . Mean duration of preoperative symptoms was longer in the diverticulitis group ( 3.6 ± 3.8 days vs. 1.8 ± 3.2 days , P < 0.05 ) . The site of abdominal pain , fever , signs of localized peritonitis , accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms , and white blood cell count showed no differences between the two groups . Twenty - five patients ( 65.8 % ) of the diverticulitis group and 10 patients ( 10.2 % ) of the appendicitis group showed perforation of appendix ( P < 0.05 ) .

Subjects received an isocaloric diet with fiber - enriched products for the first 4 weeks and with regular flour products for the following 4 weeks , or vice versa . Weight , height , measures of fat distribution ( waist , hip circumference ) , glucose , insulin and triglycerides were measured at baseline , after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention . BMI and insulin sensitivity indices were calculated . Weight and BMI decreased in the first period of isocaloric diet in both groups , regardless of the type of flour consumed ( weight p<0.01 , p<0.001 respectively ; BMI p = 0.01 , p<0.001 respectively ) . At the end of the 8 weeks , weight and BMI further decreased in the group consuming the fiber - enriched diet ( p<0.01 ) . Insulin resistance , estimated with the Homeostasis Model Assessment index and the Lipid Accumulation Product index , improved in all subjects after the fiber - enriched flour diet ( p = 0.03 , p = 0.02 , respectively ) . In conclusion , an isocaloric diet supplemented with fiber - enriched products may improve measures of fatness and insulin sensitivity in healthy non - obese non - diabetic subjects . We might hypothesize a similar effect also in subjects with metabolic abnormalities .",attention,Fiber enriched flour || Normal flour || Insulin resistance,"[(210, 249)]",1,test,scaled attention
259,259,5244277_6,5244277,"TITLE : A patient preference study that evaluated fluticasone furoate and mometasone furoate nasal sprays for allergic rhinitis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Corticosteroid nasal sprays are the mainstay of treatment for allergic rhinitis . These sprays have sensory attributes such as scent and/or odor , taste and aftertaste , and run down the throat and/or the nose , which , when unpleasant , can affect patient preference for , and compliance with , treatment . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : : This study examined patient preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray ( FFNS ) or mometasone furoate nasal spray ( MFNS ) based on their sensory attributes after administration in patients with allergic rhinitis . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : This was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , cross - over study . Patient preferences were determined by using three questionnaires ( Overall Preference , Immediate Attributes , and Delayed Attributes ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Overall , 56 % of patients stated a preference for FFNS versus 32 % for MFNS ( p < 0.001 ) ; the remaining 12 % stated no preference . More patients stated a preference for FFNS versus MFNS for the attributes of "" less drip down the throat "" ( p < 0.001 ) , "" less run out of the nose "" ( p < 0.05 ) , "" more soothing "" ( p < 0.05 ) , and "" less irritating "" ( p < 0.001 ) . More patients responded in favor of FFNS versus MFNS for the immediate attributes , "" run down the throat "" ( p < 0.001 ) , and "" run out of the nose "" ( p < 0.001 ) , and , in the delayed attributes , "" run down the throat "" ( p < 0.001 ) , "" run out of the nose "" ( p < 0.01 ) , "" presence of aftertaste "" ( p < 0.01 ) , and "" no nasal irritation "" ( p < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : Patients with allergic rhinitis preferred FFNS versus MFNS overall and based on a number of individual attributes , including "" less drip down the throat , "" "" less run out of the nose , "" and "" less irritating . "" Greater preference may improve patient adherence and thereby improve symptom management of the patient 's allergic rhinitis .",scaled attention,fluticasone furoate nasal spray || mometasone furoate nasal spray || Preference for more soothing,"[(182, 233)]",2,test,scaled attention
454,454,3034877_3,3034877,"TITLE : Sunlight exposure or vitamin D supplementation for vitamin D - deficient non - western immigrants : a randomized clinical trial ABSTRACT.SUMMARY : Vitamin D deficiency is very common in non - western immigrants . In this randomized clinical trial , vitamin D 800 IU / day or 100,000 IU/3 months were compared with advised sunlight exposure . Vitamin D supplementation was more effective than advised sunlight exposure in improving vitamin D status and lowering parathyroid hormone levels . ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Vitamin D deficiency ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] < 25 nmol / l ) is common among non - western immigrants . It can be treated with vitamin D supplementation or sunlight exposure . ABSTRACT.METHODS : To determine whether the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation ( daily 800 IU or 100,000 IU/3 months ) or sunlight exposure advice is similar with regard to serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) concentrations . Randomized clinical trial in 11 general practices in The Netherlands . Non - western immigrants , aged 18–65 years ( n = 232 ) and serum 25(OH)D < 25 nmol / l were randomly assigned to supplementation ( daily 800 IU or 100,000 IU/3 months ) or advice for sunlight exposure for 6 months ( March – September ) . Blood samples were collected at baseline , during treatment ( 3 months , 6 months ) , and at follow - up ( 12 months ) . Statistical analysis was performed with multilevel regression modelling . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The intention - to - treat analysis included 211 persons . Baseline serum 25(OH)D was 22.5 ± 11.1 nmol / l . After 6 months , mean serum 25(OH)D increased to 53 nmol / l with 800 IU / day , to 50.5 nmol / l with 100,000 IU/3 months , and to 29.1 nmol / l with advised sunlight exposure ( supplementation vs sunshine p < 0.001 ) . Serum PTH decreased significantly in all groups after 3 months , more in the supplementation groups than in the advised sunlight group ( p < 0.05 ) . There was no significant effect on physical performance and functional limitations . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Vitamin D supplementation is more effective than advised sunlight exposure for treating vitamin D deficiency in non - western immigrants .",attention,"vitamin D 800 IU/day or 100,000 IU/3 months || sunlight exposure || parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations","[(324, 351)]",1,test,attention
610,610,3386590_0,3386590,"TITLE : Patient Follow - Up After Participating in a Beach - Based Skin Cancer Screening Program ABSTRACT : Many skin cancer screenings occur in non - traditional community settings , with the beach being an important setting due to beachgoers being at high risk for skin cancer . This study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial of a skin cancer intervention in which participants ( n = 312 ) had a full - body skin examination by a clinician and received a presumptive diagnosis ( abnormal finding , no abnormal finding ) . Participants ' pursuit of follow - up was assessed post - intervention ( n = 283 ) . Analyses examined : ( 1 ) participant 's recall of screening results ; and ( 2 ) whether cognitive and behavioral variables were associated with follow - up being as advised . Just 12 % of participants ( 36/312 ) did not correctly recall the results of their skin examination . One - third ( 33 % , 93/283 ) of participants ' follow - up was classified as being not as advised ( recommend follow - up not pursued , unadvised follow - up pursued ) . Among participants whose follow - up was not as advised , 71 % ( 66/93 ) did not seek recommended care . None of the measured behavioral and cognitive variables were significantly associated with recall of screening examination results or whether follow - up was as advised . Research is needed to determine what factors are associated with follow - up being as advised and to develop messages that increase receipt of advised follow - up care .",others,bihevioral variables || cognitive variables || follow up advised,"[(226, 251)]",0,test,deeplift
