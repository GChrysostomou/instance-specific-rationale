ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : In a majority of cases , whiplash injuries are a domain of conservative therapy . Nevertheless it remains unclear whether physical therapy is of medical or economic benefit in patients with whiplash injuries . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seventy patients with acute Quebec Task Force ( QTF ) grade II whiplash injuries were randomized to two therapy groups and received either active ( APT ) or passive ( PPT ) physical therapy . Patients were compared with regard to pain and range of motion with data obtained in an earlier study from a group with grade II whiplash injuries in which the therapy recommendation had been "" act as usual "" ( AAU ; n = 20 ) . The above - mentioned parameters were assessed at 24 hours and two months after the injury . Furthermore patients ' period of disability was documented after two months . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After two months , patients in both the APT and PPT groups showed significant improvement in the median period of disability ( active : 14 days ; passive : 14 days ) compared to the AAU group ( 49 days ) . No group difference was observed with regard to median improvement in range of motion ( active : 120 ° ; passive : 108 ° ; activity as usual : 70 ° ) . The median pain reduction was significantly greater in the APT group ( 50.5 ) than in the PPT ( 39.2 ) or AAU group ( 28.8 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Our data show that active physical therapy results in enhanced pain reduction and shortening of post - injury disability . Therefore , active physical therapy should be considered the treatment of choice in patients with QTF grade II whiplash injuries .

Microdialysis ( MD ) can be used in vivo to study muscle alterations in FMS . Furthermore for chronic pain conditions such as FMS , the mechanisms for the positive effects of exercise are unclear . This study investigates the interstitial concentrations of algesics and metabolites in the vastus lateralis muscle of 29 women with FMS and 28 healthy women before and after an exercise intervention . ABSTRACT.METHODS : All the participants went through a clinical examination and completed a questionnaire . In addition , their pressure pain thresholds ( PPTs ) in their upper and lower extremities were determined . For both groups , MD was conducted in the vastus lateralis muscle before and after a 15-week exercise intervention of mainly resistance training of the lower limbs . Muscle blood flow and interstitial muscle concentrations of lactate , pyruvate , glutamate , glucose , and glycerol were determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : FMS was associated with significantly increased interstitial concentrations of glutamate , pyruvate , and lactate . After the exercise intervention , the FMS group exhibited significant decreases in pain intensity and in mean interstitial concentrations of glutamate , pyruvate , and glucose . The decrease in pain intensity in FMS correlated significantly with the decreases in pyruvate and glucose . In addition , the FMS group increased their strength and endurance . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : This study supports the suggestion that peripheral metabolic and algesic muscle alterations are present in FMS patients and that these alterations contribute to pain .

12,4202567_0,4202567,"TITLE : The Polarity - Dependent Effects of the Bilateral Brain Stimulation on Working Memory ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Working memory plays a critical role in cognitive processes which are central to our daily life . Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLFPC ) . This study was aimed to assess whether bilateral modulation of the DLPFC using a noninvasive brain stimulation , namely transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , modifies the working memory function in healthy adults . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized sham - controlled cross - over study , 60 subjects ( 30 Males ) received sham and active tDCS in two subgroups ( anode left / cathode right and anode right / cathode left ) of the DLPFC . Subjects were presented working memory n - back task while the reaction time and accuracy were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : A repeated measures , mixed design ANOVA indicated a significant difference between the type of stimulation ( sham vs. active ) in anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC with cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC [ F(1,55)= 5.29 , P=0.019 ] , but not the inverse polarity worsened accuracy in the 2-back working memory task . There were also no statistically significant changes in speed of working memory [ F(1,55)= 0.458,P=0.502 ] related to type or order of stimulation . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : The results would imply to a polarity dependence of bilateral tDCS of working memory . Left anodal/ right cathodal stimulation of DLPFC could impair working memory , while the reverser stimulation had no effect . Meaning that bilateral stimulation of DLFC would not be a useful procedure to improve working memory . Further studies are required to understand subtle effects of different tDCS stimulation / inhibition electrode positioning on the working memory .",attention,Transcranial direct current stimulation || Control || Working memory speed,"[(215, 230)]",0,test,attention

24,4190894_0,4190894,"TITLE : Effect of dexmedetomidine on plasma brain - derived neurotrophic factor : A double - blind , randomized and placebo - controlled study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND . : Dexmedetomidine ( DEX ) has neuro - protective effects , but the clinical mechanism remains unclear . ABSTRACT.METHOD . : Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups : group A ( control ) and group B ( treated with DEX ) . Plasma concentrations of brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) were determined in blood samples using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays at five time points : T1 ( baseline ) , T2 ( 15 minutes after intubation and before the surgery was started ) , T3 ( the end of surgery ) , T4 ( 10 minutes after extubation in the post - anesthesia care unit ) , and T5 ( 24 hours after the surgery ) . Changes in bispect ( BIS ) index , heart rates , and doses of anesthetics used for induction were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS . : Baseline plasma concentrations of BDNF did not differ between group A and group B ; 15 minutes after induction , concentrations of plasma BDNF were significantly reduced in group A. Twenty - four hours after surgery , the concentration was still higher in group B than in group A. In contrast , plasma concentrations of BDNF at other time points tested did not differ between the two groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION . : It appears that DEX could reverse the reduced plasma concentrations of BDNF caused by anesthetics , and this effect lasted for 24 hours after surgery .",attention,Dexmedetomidine || Control || Brain-derived neurotrophic factor at skin closure,"[(174, 243)]",0,test,attention

The possibility of accomplishing PLF using a mixture of porous β - CPP and iliac bone was studied . This paper reports the radiologic results of PLF using the β - CPP plus autograft for lumbar degenerative disease as a bone graft extender . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , case - matched , radiographic study evaluating the results of short segment lumbar fusion using a β - CPP plus autograft was performed to compare the efficacy of β - CPP plus autograft with that of an autograft alone for short segment lumbar fusion . Thirty one consecutive patients ( 46 levels ) underwent posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw fixation and additional posterior lumbar interbody fusion . In all patients , 3 mL of β - CPP plus 3 mL of autogenous bone graft was placed randomly in one side of a posterolateral gutter , and 6 mL of autogenous iliac bone graft was placed on the other . The fusion rates , volumes of fusion masses , and bone absorption percentage were evaluated postoperatively using simple radiographs and 3 dimensional computed tomography ( 3D - CT ) scans . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The control sides treated with an autograft showed significantly better Lenke scores than the study sides treated with β - CPP at 3 and 6 months postoperatively , but there was no difference between the two sides at 12 months .

39,4558976_0,4558976,"TITLE : The DA antagonist tiapride impairs context - related extinction learning in a novel context without affecting renewal ABSTRACT : Renewal describes the recovery of an extinguished response if recall is tested in a context different from the extinction context . Behavioral studies demonstrated that attention to relevant context strengthens renewal . Neurotransmitters mediating attention and learning such as the dopaminergic ( DA ) system presumably modulate extinction learning and renewal . However , the role of DA for non - fear - based extinction learning and renewal in humans has not yet been investigated . This fMRI study investigated effects of DA - antagonism upon context - related extinction in a predictive learning task in which extinction occurred either in a novel ( ABA ) or an unchanged ( AAA ) context . The tiapride - treated group ( TIA ) showed significantly impaired ABA extinction learning and a significant within - group difference between ABA and AAA extinction , compared to placebo ( PLAC ) . Groups did not differ in their level of ABA renewal . In ABA extinction , TIA showed reduced activation in dlPFC and OFC , hippocampus , and temporal regions . Across groups , activation in PFC and hippocampus correlated negatively with ABA extinction errors . Results suggest that in context - related extinction learning DA in PFC and hippocampus is involved in readjusting the cue - outcome relationship in the presence of a novel context . However , relating context to the appropriate association during recall does not appear to rely exclusively on DA signaling .",scaled attention,tiapride || placebo || extinction learning in a novel context (ABA condition),"[(135, 169)]",1,test,scaled attention
40,3484141_0,3484141,"TITLE : Circulating Thyroxine , Thyroid - Stimulating Hormone , and Hypothyroid Status and the Risk of Prostate Cancer ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Thyroid hormones may influence risk of cancer through their role in cell differentiation , growth , and metabolism . One study of circulating thyroid hormones supports this hypothesis with respect to prostate cancer . We undertook a prospective analysis of thyroid hormones and prostate cancer risk in the Alpha - Tocopherol , Beta - Carotene Cancer Prevention ( ATBC ) Study . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Within the ATBC Study , a randomized controlled trial of α - tocopherol and β - carotene supplements and cancer incidence in male smokers , 402 prostate cancer cases were sampled . Controls were matched 2∶1 to cases on age and date of blood collection . Odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) of prostate cancer were estimated for quintiles of serum total and free thyroxine ( T4 ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) , and by categories of thyroid status . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Men with serum higher TSH had a decreased risk of prostate cancer compared to men with lower TSH ( Q5 vs. Q1–4 : OR = 0.70 , 95 % CI : 0.51–0.97 , p = 0.03 ) . When the T4 and TSH measurements were combined to define men as hypothyroid , euthyroid or hyperthyroid , hypothyroid men had a lower risk of prostate cancer compared to euthyroid men ( OR = 0.48 , 95 % CI = 0.28–0.81 , p = 0.006 ) . We observed no association between hyperthyroid status and risk , although the number of hyperthyroid men with prostate cancer was small ( n = 9 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In this prospective study of smokers , men with elevated TSH and those classified as being in a hypothyroid state were at decreased risk of prostate cancer . Future studies should examine the association in other populations , particularly non - smokers and other racial / ethnic groups .",lime,TSH ≥2.2 μIU/mL || TSH<2.2 μIU/mL || Risk of prostate cancer,"[(186, 224)]",2,test,lime

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Totally 108 AML - CR1 patients undergoing allo - HSCT were randomized into BuCy ( busulfan 1.6 mg / kg , q12 hours , -7 ~ -4d ; cyclophosphamide 60 mg / kg.d , -3 ~ -2d ) or BuFlu ( busulfan 1.6 mg / kg , q12 hours , -5 ~ -2d ; fludarabine 30 mg / m2.d , -6 ~ -2d ) group . Hematopoietic engraftment , regimen - related toxicity ( RRT ) , graft - versus - host disease ( GVHD ) , transplant related mortality ( TRM ) , and overall survival were compared between the two groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : All patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution except for two patients who died of RRT during conditioning . All patients obtained complete donor chimerism by day +30 post - transplantation . The incidence of total and III - IV RRT were 94.4 % and 81.5 % ( P = 0.038 ) , and 16.7 % and 0.0 % ( P = 0.002 ) , respectively , in BuCy and BuFlu group . With a median follow up of 609 ( range , 3–2130 ) days after transplantation , the 5-year cumulative incidence of TRM were 18.8 ± 6.9 % and 9.9 ± 6.3 % ( P = 0.104 ) ; the 5-year cumulative incidence of leukemia relapse were 16.5 ± 5.8 % and 16.2 ± 5.3 % ( P = 0.943 ) ; the 5-year disease - free survival and overall survival were 67.4 ± 7.6 % and 75.3 ± 7.2 % ( P = 0.315 ) , and 72.3 ± 7.5 % and 81.9 ± 7.0 % ( P = 0.177 ) , respectively in BuCy and BuFlu group .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seventy older women ( > 60 years old ) voluntarily took part in the study . Participants were randomized into six different groups according to body mass index ( BMI ) : appropriate weight ( AW ) control ( AWC ) and trained ( AWT ) groups , overweight ( OW ) control ( OWC ) and trained ( OWT ) groups , and obesity ( O ) control ( OC ) and trained ( OT ) groups . The exercise program consisted of 50 minutes of exercise three times per week for 12 weeks . The exercises were alternated between upper and lower body using rest between sets for 40 seconds with intensity controlled by heart rate ( 70 % of work ) . The contraction time established was 5 seconds to eccentric and concentric muscular action phase . The following anthropometric parameters were evaluated : height ( m ) , body weight ( BW , kg ) , body fat ( BF , % ) , fat mass ( FM , kg ) , lean mass ( LM , kg ) , and BMI ( kg / m2 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The values ( mean ± standard deviation [ SD ] ) of relative changes to BW ( −8.0 % ± 0.8 % ) , BF ( −21.4 % ± 2.1 % ) , LM ( 3.0 % ± 0.3 % ) , and FM ( −31.2 % ± 3.0 % ) to the OT group were higher ( P < 0.05 ) than in the AWT ( BW : −2.0 % ± 1.1 % ; BF : −4.6 % ± 1.8 % ; FM : −7.0 % ± 2.8 % ; LM : 0.2 % ± 1.1 % ) and OWT ( BW : −4.5 % ± 1.0 % ; BF : −11.0 % ± 2.2 % ; FM : −16.1 % ± 3.2 % ; LM : −0.2 % ± 1.0 % ) groups ; additionally , no differences were found for C groups . While reduction ( P < 0.03 ) in BMI according to absolute values was observed for all trained groups ( AWT : 22 ± 1 versus 21 ± 1 ; OWT : 27 ± 1 versus 25 ± 1 , OT : 34 ± 1 versus 30 ± 1 ) after training , no differences were found for C groups .

The physical and psychological outcomes , including lumbar muscle strength , lower limb proprioception function , physical fitness , as well as self - reported symptom intensity , stress , self - esteem , mood , quality of life , quality of sleep , and adverse events , were evaluated at baseline , 13 weeks ( at the end of 12-week intervention ) , and 25 weeks ( after the 12-week follow - up period ) . Intention - to - treat analysis was performed for the above outcomes . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Compared with controls , significant improvements in Baduanjin exercise group at the end of 12-week intervention period were found on lower limb proprioception function ( the rate of average trace error on right lower limb ( % ) : control 23.50±5.50 , Baduanjin 21.92±6.54 , P=0.004 ; the rate of average trace error on left lower limb ( % ) : control 22.32±6.62 , Baduanjin 20.63±4.62 , P=0.046 ) , cardiorespiratory endurance ( step test index : control 47.66±5.94 , Baduanjin 50.07±9.30 , P=0.025 ) , flexibility ( control 14.35±7.26 cm , Baduanjin 15.39±6.43 cm , P=0.009 ) and explosive force of lower limb ( standing long jump test ( m ) : control 1.77±0.24 , Baduanjin 1.79±0.22 , P=0.005 for adjustment baseline ) in physical outcomes , and attention ( Schulte Grid test ( second ) : control 210.4±51.15 , Baduanjin 192.4±47.14 , P=0.034 ) in mental outcome . Lumbar muscle strength in Baduanjin group had been moderately enhanced but no significant difference compared to controls . No significant changes in other physical and mental outcomes , including vital capacity , blood pressure , heart rate , hand grip force , self - symptom intensity , stress , self - efficacy , quality of life , and quality of sleep , were found between groups . No adverse event was reported during the study period .

95,4759876_0,4759876,"TITLE : Subcutaneous versus intraarticular closed suction indwelling drainage after total knee arthroplasty : A randomised control trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) is widely accepted treatment for moderate or severe osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . Significant blood loss can be seen during the early postoperative period where a blood transfusion may be necessary . Closed suction drainage is known to prevent the formation of hematomas in the operative field , decrease tension on incisions , diminish delayed wound healing and reduce the risk of infection . Subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method has been known to be beneficial and an alternative to the intraarticular indwelling method . This prospective randomized study was to compare the visible , hidden , total blood loss and postoperative hemodynamic change of subcutaneous and intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method after TKA . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : One hundred and sixty patients with primary osteoarthritis who underwent unilateral TKA were enrolled ; group A with subcutaneous ( n = 78 ) and group B with intraarticular ( n = 79 ) indwelling closed suction drainage method . Total blood loss , visible blood loss , internal blood loss , postoperative day 1 , 5th , 10th day hemoglobin , hematocrit levels were compared . Allogeneic blood transfusion rate and complications related to soft tissue hematoma formation were additionally compared . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Allogenic transfusion requirements between subcutaneous drainage group and intraarticular drainage groups ( 6.4 % vs. 24.1 % ) were significantly different ( P = 0.002 ) . Although the minor complications such as the incidence of bullae formation and the ecchymosis were higher in the subcutaneous indwelling group , the functional outcome at postoperative 2 year did not demonstrate the difference from intraarticular drainage group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : Subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method is a reasonable option after TKA for reduction of postoperative bleeding and transfusion rate .",attention,subcutaneous indwelling closed suction drainage method || intraarticular indwelling closed suction drainage method || Allogeneic transfusion requirements,"[(234, 261)]",0,test,attention

98,3883373_0,3883373,"TITLE : Combination of Probiotics and Antibiotics in the Prevention of Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Children ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : We examined the preventive effect of probiotic and antibiotics versus antibiotics alone , in children with recurrent urinary tract infections ( RUTI ) in a preliminary randomized clinical trial . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Between March 2007 and April 2011 , children with the history of RUTI and unilateral vesicoureteral reflux ( VUR ) were randomly assigned to receive concomitant probiotic and antibiotics ( Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium lactis , 107 / ml , as 0.25 ml / kg three times a day regimen in addition to Nitrofurantoin , 1mg / kg daily ( group I ) . In group II , all children received conventional prophylactic antibiotics alone ( Nitrofurantoin , 1 mg / kg daily ) . Randomization was performed via using the random numerals table in a 1:1 manner with stratification by sex , age and grade of reflux . The urine examinations were done monthly and the incidence of UTI was evaluated in these two groups . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : Forty - one children ( age : 8.3±3.1 years ) in group I and 44 children ( age : 8.0±3.0 years ) in group II were compared . During the course of three years , 39 % in group I and 50 % of participants in group II experienced RUTIs ( P=0.4 ) . Incidences of UTI - febrile and afebrile - reduced in both groups without any significant differences after two years of prophylaxis .

The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of a single intra - articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells ( MPCs ) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In this phase Ib / IIa , double - blind , active comparator clinical study , 17 patients aged 18–40 years with unilateral ACL reconstruction were randomized ( 2:1 ) to receive either a single intra - articular injection of 75 million allogeneic MPCs suspended in hyaluronan ( HA ) ( MPC + HA group ) ( n = 11 ) or HA alone ( n = 6 ) . Patients were monitored for adverse events . Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti - HLA panel reactive antibodies ( PRA ) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry . Pain , function , and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) and SF-36v2 scores . Joint space width was measured from radiographs , and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + HA group and 0 out of 6 HA controls . No cell - related serious adverse effects were observed . Increases in class I PRA > 10 % were observed at week 4 in the MPC + HA group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104 . Compared with the HA group , MPC + HA - treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain , symptom , activities of daily living , and SF-36 bodily pain scores ( p < 0.05 ) . The MPC + HA group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing ( p < 0.05 ) , less tibial bone expansion ( 0.5 % vs 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.02 ) , and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss ( 0.7 % vs – 4.0 % over 26 weeks , p = 0.10 ) than the HA controls . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intra - articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following ACL reconstruction was safe , well tolerated , and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes .

[ Subjects and Methods ] A single - blind controlled clinical study was performed , including70 type 2 diabetic patients with or without diabetic peripheral neuropathy and 33 healthy volunteer controls . The 25(OH)D levels were evaluated using ultra - performance liquid chromatography , and IL-17 and IL-13 levels were assessed using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays . [ Results ] The 25(OH ) vitamin D concentration was lower in diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients than in diabetes mellitus patients without neuropathy and healthy controls . Similarly , 25(OH)D levels were lower in diabetes mellitus patients than healthy controls . IL-17 and IL-13 levels were higher in diabetes mellitus patients than in controls . Additionally , IL-13 levels were higher in diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients than in diabetes mellitus patients without neuropathy . These differences were statistically significant . There was a significant positive correlation between 25(OH)D and IL-13,and a negative correlation between 25(OH)D andIL-17 in the diabetic and diabetic neuropathy groups . [ Conclusion ] Vitamin D is a potential modifiable risk factor for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and may regulate inflammatory mediators , e.g. , IL-17 and IL-13 .",ig,diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients (GII) || diabetes mellitus patients without neuropathy (GI) || IL-13 levels,"[(186, 192)]",5,test,ig

Kinesio tape is a drug - free elastic therapeutic tape used for treating various musculoskeletal problems . The aim of this study was to investigate the short - term effects of lumbar Kinesio taping on pain intensity and disability in women with pregnancy - related low back pain . ABSTRACT.MATERIAL / METHODS : A total of 65 patients with pregnancy - related low back pain were randomly allocated into either Kinesio taping ( n=33 ) or control ( n=32 ) groups . The intervention group was treated with paracetamol plus Kinesio taping , while the control group received only paracetamol . Kinesio taping was applied in the lumbar flexion position , and four I - shaped bands were used . Two bands were attached horizontally , with space correction technique . The remaining 2 bands , 1 on each side of the lumbar spine , were placed vertically , with inhibition technique . Low back pain intensity was measured on a 10-cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , and the Roland - Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) was used for evaluation of disability . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Pain intensity and RMDQ scores improved significantly in both groups at 5 days compared with baseline . Considering the degree of treatment effect ( the change from baseline to day 5 ) , the Kinesio taping group was significantly superior than the control group in all outcome measures ( for all , P<0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study indicate that Kinesio taping can be used as a complementary treatment method to achieve effective control of pregnancy - related low back pain .",ig,Kinesio taping || Control || Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire improvement,"[(227, 282)]",5,test,ig

At least one treatment - related MAE was observed in 9.2 % of patients ( n = 17 ) assigned to the active group vs. 13.3 % of patients ( n = 26 ) in the control group ( P = 0.21 ) , a 4.1 % absolute risk reduction ( 95 % CI −2.2 to 10.4 ; P = 0.98 ) . By study design , the mean hospitalization duration was 34 % shorter in the active than in the control group ( P < 0.001 ) , and HM facilitated the early detection of technical issues and detectable clinical anomalies . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Early discharge with HM after PM implantation or replacement was safe and facilitated the monitoring of patients in the month following the procedure .",scaled attention,Discharged 24 h after PM implant/4–6 h after replacement || Usual medical practices || Treatment-related MAE,"[(155, 218)]",1,test,scaled attention
154,3400348_0,3400348,"TITLE : Effects of Telmisartan with Hydrochlorothiazide versus Valsartan with Hydrochlorothiazide in Patients with Moderate - to - Severe Hypertension ABSTRACT : Combination therapy is recommended for patients with blood pressure ( BP ) significantly above goal by recent consensus guidelines around the globe . The use of angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs ) alone or in combination with a thiazide diuretic is a preferred treatment strategy due to both efficacy and safety considerations . However , there are few data known about the benefits of ARB - diuretic combination therapy in patients with moderate - to - severe hypertension . We performed a subanalysis from two large clinical trials that compared the antihypertensive effects of telmisartan 80 mg versus valsartan 160 mg , both combined with hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) 25 mg in a subpopulation of 725 patients with moderate - to - severe hypertension ( systolic BP SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg ) . Treatment with telmisartan - HCTZ induced significantly greater reductions in BP ( −31.1/−18.3 mm Hg ) than valsartan - HCTZ ( −28.4/−16.3 mm Hg ; SBP P = 0.0265 , diastolic BP P = 0.0041 ) . More patients receiving the telmisartan combination achieved a BP goal < 140/90 mm Hg than those receiving valsartan - HCTZ . There were similar safety and tolerability data for the two active treatment groups . These findings support the use of longer - acting ARBs combined with higher doses of thiazide diuretic to improve BP control in patients with moderate - to - severe hypertension .",gradients,telmisartan 80 mg combined with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg || valsartan 160 mg combined with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg || mean reduction in BP for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP),"[(157, 194)]",3,test,gradients

This study was designed to detect the alteration in BIS reading with two different Trendelenburg ( TBG ) tilt in laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy ( LAVH ) procedure . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : A prospective , double - blinded , randomized controlled study was designed involving 40 American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I and II female patients , aged 35 - 60 years , scheduled to undergo LAVH under GA . Patients were divided into two groups with TBG > 30 ° and TBG < 30 ° . BIS readings ; systolic and diastolic blood pressure , heart rate were recorded in supine position . Patients were then shifted to desired TBG position either ( > 30 ° ) or ( < 30 ° ) as per group allotment . Data were recorded at 30 min intervals and all the patients were followed upto 24 h postoperatively for any recall . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : A rise in BIS value was noticed , when position was changed from supine to head down in both groups . During comparison between two groups with different angulations , TBG > 30 ° showed a higher BIS value than TBG < 30 ° . This statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) trend was observed at all the 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120th min interval . Interestingly , BIS values returned to preoperative levels following adopting final supine position . No incidence of awareness was reported in both the series throughout the study .

ABSTRACT : Inhibitory control of movement in motor learning requires the ability to suppress an inappropriate action , a skill needed to stop a planned or ongoing motor response in response to changes in a variety of environments .

This randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was designed to determine the clinical efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA urethral sphincter injections in patients with dysfunctional voiding or detrusor underactivity . Patients with medically refractory dysfunctional voiding ( n = 31 ) or detrusor underactivity ( n = 31 ) were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive either onabotulinumtoxinA ( 100 U ) ( n = 38 ) or placebo ( normal saline ) ( n = 24 ) . There were no significant differences in subjective or objective parameters between patients who received onabotulinumtoxinA and those who received saline injection therapy , and the overall success rate was 43.5 % ( reduction in Patient perception of Bladder Condition by ≥2 : onabotulinumtoxinA 36.8 % vs placebo 54.2 % , p = 0.114 ) . The results were similar between the dysfunctional voiding and detrusor underactivity subgroups ; however , a significant reduction in detrusor voiding pressure was only observed in dysfunctional voiding patients who received onabotulinumtoxinA.

Trials directly comparing IDegLira with alternative strategies for intensifying basal insulin are ongoing . While awaiting results , this analysis compared indirectly how different strategies affected glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and other outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A pooled analysis of five completed Novo Nordisk randomized clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on basal insulin was used to compare indirectly IDegLira ( N = 199 ) with : addition of liraglutide to basal insulin ( N = 225 ) [ glucagon - like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1RA ) add - on strategy ] ; basal – bolus ( BB ) insulin [ insulin glargine ( IGlar ) + insulin aspart ] ( N = 56 ) ; or up - titration of IGlar ( N = 329 ) . A supplementary analysis was performed with the BB arm including patients who received IGlar or IDeg as basal insulin in the relevant trial ( N = 210 ) . All trials had comparable inclusion / exclusion criteria and baseline characteristics . Individual patient - level data were analyzed using multivariable statistical models with potential baseline heterogeneity accounted for using explanatory variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At end of study , differences between IDegLira and BB or up - titrated IGlar , respectively , were as follows : reduction in HbA1c −0.30 % , 95 % confidence interval ( – 0.58 ; −0.01 ) and −0.65 % ( −0.83 ; −0.47 ) ; change in body weight −6.89 kg ( −7.92 ; −5.86 ) and −4.04 kg ( −4.69 ; −3.40 ) all in favor of IDegLira . Confirmed hypoglycemia rate was 122.8 ( 90.7 ; 166.1 ) , 1060.8 ( 680.2 ; 1654.4 ) , and 286.1 ( 231.1 ; 354.1 ) events/100 patient - years for IDegLira , BB , and up - titrated IGlar , respectively . Odds ratios for achieving HbA1c < 7.0 % , < 7.0 % without hypoglycemia , and < 7.0 % without hypoglycemia and no weight gain were greater with IDegLira versus up - titrated IGlar . The supplementary analysis yielded similar results to the main analysis . Results with IDegLira were similar to those for the ' GLP-1RA add - on ' arm .

ABSTRACT.RESULTS : For the study group , compared with the standard or control group , had a significantly reduced operation time ( 60.15±9.97 min vs. 71.85±9.74 min ) and suturing time ( 18.05±4.71 min vs. 28.35±3.13 min ) ( both p<0.05 ) , significantly less intraoperative blood loss ( 93.25±19.62 ml vs. 121.50±24.87 ml ) ( p<0.05 ) and significantly less reduction in postoperative hemoglobin levels ( 8.9±1.97 g / L vs. 11.15±2.23 g / L ) ( p<0.05 ) . There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in duration of the use of the indwelling drainage tube , drainage volume , or time to recovery of gastrointestinal function ( all , p>0.05 ) . Following surgery , blood transfusion was given to one patient in the study group and two patients in the control group . One patient from each group had a fever .

We aimed to compare a subjective risk - assessment - only questionnaire ( RAO ) for common sleep disorder screening against the same risk - assessment questionnaire plus a nasal flow monitor as an objective marker of possible underlying obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ( RA+ ) in a community pharmacy setting . The primary outcome was the number of participants identified in RAO or RA+ group who were likely to have and consequently be diagnosed with OSA . Further outcomes included the number of participants identified as being at risk for , referred for , taking - up referral for , and then diagnosed with OSA , insomnia , and/or restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) in either group . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a cluster - randomized trial , participants were recruited through 23 community pharmacies . Using validated instruments , 325 ( RAO = 152 , RA+ = 173 ) participants were screened for OSA , insomnia , and RLS . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : 218 ( 67 % ) participants were at risk of OSA , insomnia or RLS and these participants were referred to their primary physician . The proportion of screened participants identified as being at risk of OSA was significantly higher in the RA+ group ( 36 % in RAO vs. 66 % in RA+ , OR 3.4 , 95 % CI ( 1.8–6.5 ) , p<0.001 ) .

The proportion of screened participants identified as being at risk of OSA was significantly higher in the RA+ group ( 36 % in RAO vs. 66 % in RA+ , OR 3.4 , 95 % CI ( 1.8–6.5 ) , p<0.001 ) . A 12-month follow - up was completed in 125 RAO and 155 RA+ participants . Actual referral uptake was 34 % RAO , 26 % RA+ , OR 4.4 , 95 % CI ( 1.4–19.2 ) , p = 0.31 . The OSA diagnosis rate was higher in the RA+ arm ( p = 0.01 ) . To yield a single additional confirmed OSA diagnosis , 16 people would need to be screened using the RA+ protocol . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that utilising either screening method is feasible in identifying individuals in the community pharmacy setting who are likely to have OSA , insomnia and/or RLS .

We aimed to compare a subjective risk - assessment - only questionnaire ( RAO ) for common sleep disorder screening against the same risk - assessment questionnaire plus a nasal flow monitor as an objective marker of possible underlying obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ( RA+ ) in a community pharmacy setting . The primary outcome was the number of participants identified in RAO or RA+ group who were likely to have and consequently be diagnosed with OSA . Further outcomes included the number of participants identified as being at risk for , referred for , taking - up referral for , and then diagnosed with OSA , insomnia , and/or restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) in either group .

Bilateral intervention approaches have also been shown to be effective in augmenting motor function after stroke . The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral TENS combined with TOT versus unilateral TENS combined with TOT in improving lower‐limb motor function in subjects with chronic stroke . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS : Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to bilateral TENS+TOT or to unilateral TENS+TOT and underwent 20 sessions of training over a 10‐week period . The outcome measures included the maximal strength of the lower‐limb muscles and the results of the Lower Extremity Motor Coordination Test , Berg Balance Scale , Step Test , and Timed Up and Go test . Each participant was assessed at baseline , after 10 and 20 sessions of training and 3 months after the cessation of training . The subjects in the bilateral TENS+TOT group showed greater improvement in paretic ankle dorsiflexion strength ( β=1.32 ; P=0.032 ) and in the completion time for the Timed Up and Go test ( β=−1.54 ; P=0.004 ) than those in the unilateral TENS+TOT group . However , there were no significant between‐group differences for other outcome measures . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The application of bilateral TENS over the common peroneal nerve combined with TOT was superior to the application of unilateral TENS combined with TOT in improving paretic ankle dorsiflexion strength after 10 sessions of training and in improving the completion time for the Timed Up and Go test after 20 sessions of training .

Stimulants are considered first - line pharmacological treatment and are the most prescribed treatment for ADHD . However , approximately 30 % of children with ADHD do not have an optimal response to a single stimulant and may require adjunctive therapy . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to conduct a cost - effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) of adding a non - stimulant , guanfacine extended release ( GXR ) , to stimulants versus maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness from a US third - party payer perspective . Effectiveness was measured by the QALY . The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states ( normal , mild , moderate and severe ) , defined by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI - S ) scale . Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient - level data from a multicentre , 9-week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - optimization study , where subjects ( n=461 ) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning , GXR administered in the evening , or placebo . The model assumed that patients in moderate / severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period . Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs , all in $ US , year 2010 values . Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks . Oneway sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis ( PSA ) were conducted by varying costs , utilities , adverse - event duration , and transition probabilities . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy , adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $ US1016 but a lower medical cost of $ US124 , resulting in a total incremental cost of $ US892 at 1 year . The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) of $ US31 660 / QALY . In one - way sensitivity analysis , ICER values ranged from $ US19 723 , when 100 % of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state , to $ US46631 , when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period . PSA demonstrated a 94.6 % likelihood that the ICER falls below $ US50 000 / QALY . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized . This is the first analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive medication . This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with stimulants is a cost - effective treatment based on a willingness - to - pay threshold of $ US50 000 / QALY .

The hand - on - syringe ( HS ) needle technique is ideally suited to the emergency department setting because it allows a single operator to perform the block without assistance .

ABSTRACT.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES : : To study the efficacy of silicone gel in prevention of hypertrophic scars at donor site of skin grafting . ABSTRACT.DESIGN : : Prospective randomized placebo controlled double blind study . ABSTRACT.SETTING : : The study was conducted in the department of Plastic Surgery , Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences ( SVIMS ) University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India from June 2007 to June 2009 . Patients were recruited during follow - up in the OPD . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The susceptibility to scar development varied among patients ; therefore , donor site scars were divided into upper half and lower half . Two types of coded gel prepared by an independent pharmacist were used on either half . Thus , selection and assessment biases and confounders were eliminated . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : 100 scars in 50 patients were randomized into two arms , 50 control and 50 silicone gel . The median age was 25.5 years and there were 30 men ( 60 % ) and 20 women ( 40 % ) . Thirty - seven patients ( 74 % ) had good compliance . The overall incidence of donor site hypertrophic scar was 94 % ( 47 out of 50 ) . At the second month postoperatively , the silicone gel scars were scored lower when compared with the control scars . The differences were statistically significant in all parameters , including pigmentation ( P = 0.001 ) , Vascularity ( P = 0.010 ) , pliability ( P = 0.001 ) , and height ( P = 0.010 ) .

ABSTRACT.SETTING : : The study was conducted in the department of Plastic Surgery , Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences ( SVIMS ) University , Tirupati , Andhra Pradesh , India from June 2007 to June 2009 . Patients were recruited during follow - up in the OPD . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The susceptibility to scar development varied among patients ; therefore , donor site scars were divided into upper half and lower half . Two types of coded gel prepared by an independent pharmacist were used on either half . Thus , selection and assessment biases and confounders were eliminated . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : 100 scars in 50 patients were randomized into two arms , 50 control and 50 silicone gel . The median age was 25.5 years and there were 30 men ( 60 % ) and 20 women ( 40 % ) . Thirty - seven patients ( 74 % ) had good compliance . The overall incidence of donor site hypertrophic scar was 94 % ( 47 out of 50 ) . At the second month postoperatively , the silicone gel scars were scored lower when compared with the control scars . The differences were statistically significant in all parameters , including pigmentation ( P = 0.001 ) , Vascularity ( P = 0.010 ) , pliability ( P = 0.001 ) , and height ( P = 0.010 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : The effect of silicone gel in prevention of hypertrophic scar development in donor site scars is promising . Success of silicone gel in its prophylactic role will create its routine use in all types of surgery to minimize the formation of hypertrophic scars in the early postoperative period .",scaled attention,"silicone gel || control group || pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, and height of the scar","[(299, 338)]",1,test,scaled attention

253,5244277_0,5244277,"TITLE : A patient preference study that evaluated fluticasone furoate and mometasone furoate nasal sprays for allergic rhinitis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Corticosteroid nasal sprays are the mainstay of treatment for allergic rhinitis . These sprays have sensory attributes such as scent and/or odor , taste and aftertaste , and run down the throat and/or the nose , which , when unpleasant , can affect patient preference for , and compliance with , treatment . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : : This study examined patient preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray ( FFNS ) or mometasone furoate nasal spray ( MFNS ) based on their sensory attributes after administration in patients with allergic rhinitis . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : This was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , cross - over study . Patient preferences were determined by using three questionnaires ( Overall Preference , Immediate Attributes , and Delayed Attributes ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Overall , 56 % of patients stated a preference for FFNS versus 32 % for MFNS ( p < 0.001 ) ; the remaining 12 % stated no preference .

Therefore , it is relevant and necessary to systematically manipulate website characteristics to test their effect on website use . This study focuses on user control as a website characteristic . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To test whether and how user control ( the freedom of choice to skip pages ) can increase website use and knowledge gained from the website . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants older than 18 years were drawn from the Dutch Internet population ( in June 2011 ) and completed a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire .

Participants completed ( 1 ) a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website ( except for the control group ) , and ( 2 ) a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire after one week to test whether participants in the experimental groups only clicked through the website or actually processed and learned its content . Server registrations were used to assess website use . Analyses of covariance ( ANCOVA ) using all available data were conducted to determine whether user control increases website use . Structural equation models ( SEM ) using all available data were constructed to test how user control increases website use — a latent variable derived from number of pages visited and time on website . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 1044 persons invited to participate , 668 took part ( 668/1044 , 64.0 % ) . One half of participants ( 332/668 49.7 % ) were female and the mean age was 49 years ( SD 16 ) .

Participants completed ( 1 ) a questionnaire of validated measures regarding user perceptions immediately after exposure to the website ( except for the control group ) , and ( 2 ) a hepatitis knowledge questionnaire after one week to test whether participants in the experimental groups only clicked through the website or actually processed and learned its content . Server registrations were used to assess website use . Analyses of covariance ( ANCOVA ) using all available data were conducted to determine whether user control increases website use . Structural equation models ( SEM ) using all available data were constructed to test how user control increases website use — a latent variable derived from number of pages visited and time on website . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 1044 persons invited to participate , 668 took part ( 668/1044 , 64.0 % ) . One half of participants ( 332/668 49.7 % ) were female and the mean age was 49 years ( SD 16 ) . A total of 571 participants completed the one - week follow - up measure regarding hepatitis knowledge ( 571/668 , 85.5 % ) . The findings demonstrate that having less user control ( ie , a tunneled version of the website ) had a negative effect on users ' perception of efficiency ( F1,452 = 97.69 , P < .001 ) , but a positive effect on number of pages visited ( F1,452 = 171.49 , P < .001 ) , time on the website ( F1,452 = 6.32 , P = .01 ) , and knowledge gained from the website ( F1,452 = 134.32 , P < .001 ) . The direct effect of having less user control appeared to surpass the effect mediated by efficiency , because website use was higher among participants exposed to the tunneled version of the website in comparison with those having the freedom of choice to skip pages .

Its efficacy in providing analgesia for SIL cholecystectomy ( SILC ) via the same approach remains unexplored . ABSTRACT.AIMS : : The primary objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral TAP block with local anesthetic infiltration for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing SILC . ABSTRACT.SETTINGS AND DESIGN : : This was a prospective , randomized , controlled , double - blinded trial performed in a tertiary care hospital . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : Forty - two patients undergoing SILC were randomized to receive either ultrasound - guided ( USG ) bilateral mid - axillary TAP blocks with 0.375 % ropivacaine or local anesthetic infiltration of the port site . The primary outcome measure was the requirement of morphine in the first 24 h postoperatively . ABSTRACT.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : : The data were analyzed using t - test , Mann – Whitney test or Chi - square test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The 24 h morphine requirement ( mean ± standard deviation ) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in local infiltration group ( P = 0.688 ) . The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in TAP group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 ( P = 0.028 ) .

277,5062234_4,5062234,"TITLE : Analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane block versus local anesthetic infiltration in adult patients undergoing single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy : A randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block has been used to provide intra- and post - operative analgesia with single incision laparoscopic ( SIL ) bariatric and gynecological surgery with mixed results . Its efficacy in providing analgesia for SIL cholecystectomy ( SILC ) via the same approach remains unexplored . ABSTRACT.AIMS : : The primary objective of our study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral TAP block with local anesthetic infiltration for perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing SILC . ABSTRACT.SETTINGS AND DESIGN : : This was a prospective , randomized , controlled , double - blinded trial performed in a tertiary care hospital . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : Forty - two patients undergoing SILC were randomized to receive either ultrasound - guided ( USG ) bilateral mid - axillary TAP blocks with 0.375 % ropivacaine or local anesthetic infiltration of the port site . The primary outcome measure was the requirement of morphine in the first 24 h postoperatively . ABSTRACT.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : : The data were analyzed using t - test , Mann – Whitney test or Chi - square test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The 24 h morphine requirement ( mean ± standard deviation ) was 34.57 ± 14.64 mg in TAP group and 32.76 ± 14.34 mg in local infiltration group ( P = 0.688 ) . The number of patients requiring intraoperative supplemental fentanyl in TAP group was 8 and in local infiltration group was 16 ( P = 0.028 ) . The visual analog scale scores at rest and on coughing were significantly higher in the local infiltration group in the immediate postoperative period ( P = 0.034 and P = 0.007 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : USG bilateral TAP blocks were not effective in decreasing 24 h morphine requirement as compared to local anesthetic infiltration in patients undergoing SILC although it provided some analgesic benefit intraoperatively and in the initial 4 h postoperatively . Hence , the benefits of TAP blocks are not worth the effort and time spent for administering them for this surgery .",scaled attention,Transversus abdominis plane block with 0.375% ropivacaine || local anesthetic infiltration of the port site. || intraoperative supplemental fentanyl,"[(254, 280)]",1,test,scaled attention

294,5600923_4,5600923,"TITLE : Alginate Oligosaccharide DP5 Exhibits Antitumor Effects in Osteosarcoma Patients following Surgery ABSTRACT : Osteosarcoma is a malignant musculoskeletal tumor that has high - rate morbidity and mortality worldwide . Alginate oligosaccharide ( AOS ) , a natural product , has antitumor activities and may have therapeutic effects in osteosarcoma , the molecular mechanisms of which remain unclear . AOS was prepared from alginate sodium using alginate lyase . The fractions of AOS were further isolated by size - exclusion chromatography and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI - MS ) . Osteosarcoma patients were enrolled in the study and assigned into two groups : AOS ( AG , oral administration of 10-mg AOS daily ) and control groups ( CG , placebo ) . Preoperative and postoperative clinical data were investigated and analyzed . Four different degrees of polymerizations ( DPs ) were isolated and denominated as DP2 , DP3 , DP4 , and DP5 . Among these polymers , only DP5 showed antitumor functions on osteosarcoma cells . Before surgery and the outcome of primary end point after surgery , no significant differences were observed for clinical data and tumor size between the AG and CG groups ( P > 0.05 ) . After 2-year therapy , the mean tumor volume was 214.6 ± 145.7 c.c . in AG and 467.2 ± 225.3 c.c in CG ( P < 0.01 ) . The rate of local recurrence was 44.9 and 68.7 % in AG and CG , respectively ( P < 0.01 ) . AOS treatment resulted in the increase in serum levels of SOD , GSH , HDL - C , and reduction in the levels of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) beta and IL-6 ; the ratios of AST / ALT ; and triglycerides , total cholesterol ( TC ) , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL - C , and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) ( P < 0.05 ) .

295,4558453_0,4558453,"TITLE : Effects of Exercise in Immersive Virtual Environments on Cortical Neural Oscillations and Mental State ABSTRACT : Virtual reality environments are increasingly being used to encourage individuals to exercise more regularly , including as part of treatment those with mental health or neurological disorders . The success of virtual environments likely depends on whether a sense of presence can be established , where participants become fully immersed in the virtual environment . Exposure to virtual environments is associated with physiological responses , including cortical activation changes . Whether the addition of a real exercise within a virtual environment alters sense of presence perception , or the accompanying physiological changes , is not known . In a randomized and controlled study design , moderate - intensity Exercise ( i.e. , self - paced cycling ) and No - Exercise ( i.e. , automatic propulsion ) trials were performed within three levels of virtual environment exposure . Each trial was 5 minutes in duration and was followed by posttrial assessments of heart rate , perceived sense of presence , EEG , and mental state . Changes in psychological strain and physical state were generally mirrored by neural activation patterns . Furthermore , these changes indicated that exercise augments the demands of virtual environment exposures and this likely contributed to an enhanced sense of presence .",attention,Exercise of moderate intensity || No exercise || Sense of presence in virtual immersive environment,"[(199, 223)]",0,test,attention
296,5564101_0,5564101,"TITLE : The efficacy of an elevated concentration of lidocaine HCl in impacted lower third molar surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : There have been few studies on the effect of an elevated concentration of lidocaine hydrochloride in the surgical removal of an impacted lower third molar . This study aimed to examine the efficacy of 4 % lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine compared to 2 % lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine as inferior alveolar nerve block for the removal of an impacted lower third molar . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This single - blind study involved 31 healthy patients ( mean age : 23 y ; range : 19 - 33 y ) with symmetrically impacted lower third molars as observed on panoramic radiographs . Volunteers required 2 surgical interventions by the same surgeon with a 3-week washout period . The volunteers were assigned either 4 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine or 2 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as local anesthetic during each operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We recorded the time of administration , need for additional anesthetic administration , total volume of anesthetic used . We found that the patient 's preference for either of the 2 types of local anesthetic were significantly different ( P < 0.05 ) . However , the extent of pulpal anesthesia , surgical duration , and duration of soft tissue anesthesia were not significantly different . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggested that inferior alveolar nerve block using 4 % lidocaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine as a local anesthetic was clinically more effective than that using 2 % lidocaine HCl with 1:100,000 epinephrine ; the surgical duration was not affected , and no clinically adverse effects were encountered .",scaled attention,"4% lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine || 2% lidocaine along with 1:100,000 epinephrine || the duration of anesthesia","[(207, 229)]",1,test,scaled attention

316,4023937_0,4023937,"TITLE : Village - Randomized Clinical Trial of Home Distribution of Zinc for Treatment of Childhood Diarrhea in Rural Western Kenya ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Zinc treatment shortens diarrhea episodes and can prevent future episodes . In rural Africa , most children with diarrhea are not brought to health facilities . In a village - randomized trial in rural Kenya , we assessed if zinc treatment might have a community - level preventive effect on diarrhea incidence if available at home versus only at health facilities . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We randomized 16 Kenyan villages ( 1,903 eligible children ) to receive a 10-day course of zinc and two oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) sachets every two months at home and 17 villages ( 2,241 eligible children ) to receive ORS at home , but zinc at the health – facility only . Children 's caretakers were educated in zinc / ORS use by village workers , both unblinded to intervention arm . We evaluated whether incidence of diarrhea and acute lower respiratory illness ( ALRI ) reported at biweekly home visits and presenting to clinic were lower in zinc villages , using poisson regression adjusting for baseline disease rates , distance to clinic , and children 's age . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There were no differences between village groups in diarrhea incidence either reported at the home or presenting to clinic . In zinc villages ( 1,440 children analyzed ) , 61.2 % of diarrheal episodes were treated with zinc , compared to 5.4 % in comparison villages ( 1,584 children analyzed , p<0.0001 ) . There were no differences in ORS use between zinc ( 59.6 % ) and comparison villages ( 58.8 % ) . Among children with fever or cough without diarrhea , zinc use was low ( < 0.5 % ) . There was a lower incidence of reported ALRI in zinc villages ( adjusted RR 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.46–0.99 ) , but not presenting at clinic .

This two - part study was randomized , double blind , placebo controlled in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD : Part 1 : single - dose escalation , GB 12.5 , 25 , 50 , 100 or 200 μg versus placebo ; Part 2 : repeat - dose ( 7-day ) , four - period crossover , GB 12.5 , 25 or 50 μg twice daily ( BID ) versus placebo , with an open - label extension in which all patients received tiotropium 18 μg once daily . On the morning of Day 8 in all five periods , patients also received formoterol 12 μg . In study Part 1 , 27 patients were recruited . All GB doses significantly increased from baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) area under the curve ( AUC0–12h ) and peak FEV1 , with a trend toward greater efficacy with higher GB dose . All adverse events were mild – moderate in severity , with a lower incidence with GB than placebo and no evidence of a dose – response relationship . In study Part 2 , of 38 patients recruited , 34 completed the study . Adjusted mean differences from placebo in 12 h trough FEV1 on Day 7 ( primary ) were 115 , 142 and 136 mL for GB 12.5 , 25 and 50 μg BID , respectively ( all P<0.001 ) . GB 25 and 50 μg BID were superior ( P<0.05 ) to GB 12.5 μg BID for pre - dose morning FEV1 on Day 8 . For this endpoint , GB 25 and 50 μg BID were also superior to tiotropium . Compared with Day 7 , addition of formoterol significantly increased Day 8 FEV1 peak and AUC0–12h with all GB doses and placebo ( all P<0.001 ) . All adverse events were mild – moderate in severity and there was no indication of a dose - related relationship . This study provides initial evidence on bronchodilation , safety and pharmacokinetics of extrafine GB BID . Overall , the results suggest that GB 25 μg BID is the optimal dose in patients with COPD .",scaled attention,Glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg || Glycopyrronium bromide 200 μg || FEV1,"[(177, 215)]",1,test,scaled attention

There are two currently marketed vibrating plates : a ) the whole plate oscillates up and down ; b ) reciprocating vertical displacements on the left and right side of a fulcrum , increasing the lateral accelerations . A few studies have shown recently the effectiveness of the up - and - down plate for increasing Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) and balance ; but the effectiveness of the reciprocating plate technique remains mainly unknown . The aim was to compare the effects of WBV using a reciprocating platform at frequencies lower than 20 Hz and a walking - based exercise programme on BMD and balance in post - menopausal women . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - eight physically untrained post - menopausal women were assigned at random to a WBV group or a Walking group . Both experimental programmes consisted of 3 sessions per week for 8 months . Each vibratory session included 6 bouts of 1 min ( 12.6 Hz in frequency and 3 cm in amplitude with 60 ° of knee flexion ) with 1 min rest between bouts .

The current marketed rifaximin formulation contains polymorph alpha , the systemic bioavailability of which is very limited . This study compared the pharmacokinetics of this formulation with those of the amorphous form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Amorphous rifaximin was specifically prepared for the study and formulated as the marketed product . Two doses ( 200 mg and 400 mg ) of both formulations were given to two groups of 12 healthy volunteers of either sex according to a single - blind , randomized , two - treatment , single - dose , two - period , cross - over design . Plasma and urine samples were collected at preset times ( for 24 hours or 48 hours , respectively ) after dosing , and assayed for rifaximin concentrations by high - performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : For both dose levels , peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and cumulative urinary excretion were significantly higher after administration of amorphous rifaximin than rifaximin - α . Ninety percent confidence intervals for peak plasma concentration , area under the concentration - time curve , and urinary excretion ratios were largely outside the upper limit of the accepted ( 0.80–1.25 ) range , indicating higher systemic bioavailability of the amorphous rifaximin . The few adverse events recorded were not serious and not related to the study medications . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Rifaximin - α , a crystal polymorph , does differ from the amorphous form , the latter being systemically more bioavailable . In this regard , care must be taken when using – as a medicinal product – a formulation containing even small amounts of amorphous form , which may alter the peculiar pharmacologic properties of this poorly absorbed antibiotic .",scaled attention,Polymorph alpha rifaximin 200 mg || Amorphous rifaximin 200 mg || Area under curve 0-t,"[(190, 224)]",1,test,scaled attention

342,3314673_0,3314673,"TITLE : The Feasibility and Impact of Delivering a Mind - Body Intervention in a Virtual World ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Mind - body medical approaches may ameliorate chronic disease . Stress reduction is particularly helpful , but face - to - face delivery systems can not reach all those who might benefit . An online , 3-dimensional virtual world may be able to support the rich interpersonal interactions required of this approach . In this pilot study , we explore the feasibility of translating a face - to - face stress reduction program into an online virtual setting and estimate the effect size of the intervention . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : Domain experts in virtual world technology joined with mind body practitioners to translate an existing 8 week relaxation response - based resiliency program into an 8-week virtual world - based program in Second LifeTM ( SL ) . Twenty - four healthy volunteers with at least one month 's experience in SL completed the program . Each subject filled out the Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) and the Symptom Checklist 90- Revised ( SCL-90-R ) before and after taking part . Participants took part in one of 3 groups of about 10 subjects . The participants found the program to be helpful and enjoyable . Many reported that the virtual environment was an excellent substitute for the preferred face - to - face approach . On quantitative measures , there was a general trend toward decreased perceived stress , ( 15.7 to 15.0 ) , symptoms of depression , ( 57.6 to 57.0 ) and anxiety ( 56.8 to 54.8 ) . There was a significant decrease of 2.8 points on the SCL-90-R Global Severity Index ( p<0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This pilot project showed that it is feasible to deliver a typical mind - body medical intervention through a virtual environment and that it is well received . Moreover , the small reduction in psychological distress suggests further research is warranted . Based on the data collected for this project , a randomized trial with less than 50 subjects would be appropriately powered if perceived stress is the primary outcome .",scaled attention,Second Life program || No program || Global Severity Index of the SCL 90-r,"[(273, 291)]",1,test,scaled attention

361,4249579_0,4249579,"TITLE : Open - Label Crossover Study of Primaquine and Dihydroartemisinin - Piperaquine Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Adult Thai Subjects ABSTRACT : Dihydroartemisinin - piperaquine is an artemisinin - based combination treatment ( ACT ) recommended by the WHO for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria , and it is being used increasingly for resistant vivax malaria where combination with primaquine is required for radical cure . The WHO recently reinforced its recommendations to add a single dose of primaquine to ACTs to reduce P. falciparum transmission in low - transmission settings . The pharmacokinetics of primaquine and dihydroartemisinin - piperaquine were evaluated in 16 healthy Thai adult volunteers in a randomized crossover study . Volunteers were randomized to two groups of three sequential hospital admissions to receive 30 mg ( base ) primaquine , 3 tablets of dihydroartemisinin - piperaquine ( 120/960 mg ) , and the drugs together at the same doses . Blood sampling was performed over 3 days following primaquine and 36 days following dihydroartemisinin - piperaquine dosing . Pharmacokinetic assessment was done with a noncompartmental approach . The drugs were well tolerated . There were no statistically significant differences in dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine pharmacokinetics with or without primaquine . Dihydroartemisinin - piperaquine coadministration significantly increased plasma primaquine levels ; geometric mean ratios ( 90 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) of primaquine combined versus primaquine alone for maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , area under the concentration - time curve from 0 h to the end of the study ( AUC0–last ) , and area under the concentration - time curve from 0 h to infinity ( AUC0–∞ ) were 148 % ( 117 to 187 % ) , 129 % ( 103 to 163 % ) , and 128 % ( 102 to 161 % ) , respectively . This interaction is similar to that described recently with chloroquine and may result in an enhanced radical curative effect .

Accessory fiber posts are recently introduced to enhance the fiber post adaptation . This study evaluated the effectiveness of glass versus quartz accessory fiber posts . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : In this experimental study , 40 mandibular premolar roots with similar dimension ( radius of 3.5 ± 0.2 mm and length of 13 ± 0.5 mm ) were selected and their root canals were flared until 1.5 mm of dentin wall remained . They were randomly assigned to four groups ( n = 10 ) and restored as follows : Exacto glass fiber post ( EX ) , Exacto glass fiber post + 2 Reforpin accessories ( EXR ) , D. T. Light quartz fiber post ( DT ) , and D. T. Light quartz fiber post + 2 Fibercone accessories ( DTF ) . All posts were cemented with Duo - Link resin cement and the cores were built with the particulate filler composite . Following 1-week water storage , specimens were subjected to fracture loads in a universal testing machine . The maximum loads and failure modes were recorded and analyzed with the two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Fisher 's exact tests ( α = 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The mean fracture resistance values ( N ) were 402.8 ( EX ) , 378.4 ( EXR ) , 400.1 ( DT ) , and 348.5 ( DTF ) . Two - way ANOVA test showed neither reinforcing method ( P = 0.094 ) , nor post composition ( P = 0.462 ) had statistically significant differences on fracture resistance of the structurally compromised premolar teeth . Fisher 's exact test also demonstrated no statistically significant difference regarding two variables ( P = 0.695 ) . Core fracture was the most common failure mode ( 62.5 % ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : Glass and quartz fiber posts with or without accessories restored the weakened premolar roots equally .",scaled attention,Exacto glass fiber post || D. T.

Because of the practical difficulties encountered in improving the nutritional adequacy of traditional complementary foods and the limitations associated with the use of liquid iron supplementation for the treatment and prevention of IDA in infants and young children , recently , home - fortification with multivitamins and minerals sprinkles was recommended . This study aims to compare the effect of twice weekly versus daily supplementation with multivitamins and minerals powder ( MMP ) on anaemia prevalence , haemoglobin concentration , and growth in infants and young children in a rural community in Lao PDR . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A randomized trial was conducted in six rural communities . Children aged 6 to 52 months ( n = 336 ) were randomly assigned to a control group ( n = 110 ) or to one of two intervention groups receiving either two sachets per week ( n = 115 ) or a daily sachet ( n = 111 ) of MMP for 24 weeks ; 331 children completed the study . A finger prick of blood was taken at baseline , at week 12 , and again at week 24 to determine haemoglobin concentration . Anthropometric measurements were taken every 4 weeks . The McNemar test was used to assess within group differences at three time points in the study subjects with anaemia and one - way ANOVA was used to assess changes in mean haemoglobin concentration in the treatment groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : MMP supplementation resulted in significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration and in the reduction of anaemia prevalence in the two treatment groups compared with the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . The severely to moderately anaemic children ( Hb < 100 g / L ) on daily supplementation recovered faster than those on twice weekly supplementation . MMP was well accepted and compliance was high in both treatment groups . Overall , the improvement in the weight for age Z - score was very small and not statistically significant across the three study groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : MMP supplementation had positive effects in reduction of anaemia prevalence and in improving haemoglobin concentration . For severely to moderately anaemic children , daily MMP supplementation was more effective in improving haemoglobin concentration and reducing anaemia prevalence .

408,3332247_0,3332247,"TITLE : Observational cohort study of the safety of digoxin use in women with heart failure ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : This study aims to assess whether digoxin has a different effect on mortality risk for women than it does for men in patients with heart failure ( HF ) . ABSTRACT.DESIGN : This study uses the UK - based The Health Information Network population database in a cohort study of the impact of digoxin exposure on mortality for men and women who carry the diagnosis of HF . Digoxin exposure was assessed based on prescribing data . Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess whether there was an interaction between sex and digoxin affecting mortality hazard . ABSTRACT.SETTING : The setting was primary care outpatient practices . ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS : The study cohort consisted of 17 707 men and 19 227 women with the diagnosis of HF who contributed only time without digoxin exposure and 9487 men and 10 808 women with the diagnosis of HF who contributed time with digoxin exposure . ABSTRACT.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The main outcome measure was all - cause mortality . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The primary outcome of this study was the absence of a large interaction between digoxin use and sex affecting mortality . For men , digoxin use was associated with a HR for mortality of 1.00 , while for women , the HR was also 1.00 ( p value for interaction 0.65 ) . The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Observational data do not support the concern that there is a substantial increased risk of mortality due to the use of digoxin in women . This finding is consistent with previous observational studies but discordant with results from a post hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial of digoxin versus placebo .",scaled attention,Women diagnosed with HF || Men diagnosed with HF || All-cause mortality rate,"[(188, 241)]",1,test,scaled attention

A total of 94 patients with previously untreated metastatic CRC were included and randomised to receive raltitrexed 3 mg m−2 followed by oxaliplatin 130 mg m−2 on day 1 ( arm A ) , or CPT-11 350 mg m−2 followed by raltitrexed 3 mg m−2 ( arm B ) . In both arms treatment was repeated every 3 weeks . Intent - to - treat ( ITT ) analysis showed an overall response rate of 46 % ( 95 % CI , 29.5–57.7 % ) for arm A , and 34 % ( 95 % CI , 19.8–48.4 % ) for arm B. Median time to progression was 8.2 months for arm A and 8.8 months for arm B. After a median follow - up of 14 months , 69 % of patients included in arm A were still alive , compared to 59 % of those included in arm B. Overall , 31 patients ( 65 % ) experienced some episode of toxicity in arm A and 32 patients ( 70 % ) in arm B , usually grade 1–2 . The most common toxicity was hepatic , with 29 patients ( 60 % ) in arm A and 24 patients ( 62 % ) in arm B , and was grade 3–4 in four ( 8 % ) and four ( 9 % ) patients , respectively . In all , 14 patients ( 29 % ) from arm A and 24 patients ( 52 % ) from arm B had some grade of diarrhoea ( P<0.03 ) . Neurologic toxicity was observed in 31 patients ( 64 % ) in arm A , and was grade 3–4 in five patients ( 10 % ) , while a cholinergic syndrome was detected in nine patients ( 19 % ) in arm B. There were no differences in haematologic toxicity . One toxic death ( 2 % ) occurred in arm A and three ( 6.5 % ) in arm B. In conclusion , both schemes have high efficacy as first - line treatment in metastatic CRC and their total toxicity levels are similar .

410,4092903_0,4092903,"TITLE : Enhancing Mulberry Leaf Meal with Urea by Pelleting to Improve Rumen Fermentation in Cattle ABSTRACT : Four , ruminally fistulated crossbred ( Brahman×native ) beef cattle with initial body weight of 420±15 kg were randomly assigned according to a 4×4 Latin square design . The dietary treatments were mulberry leaf pellet ( MUP ) supplementation at 0 , 200 , 400 and 600 g / hd / d with rice straw fed to allow ad libitum intake . All steers were kept in individual pens and supplemented with concentrate at 5 g / kg of body weight daily . The experiment was 4 periods , and each lasted 21 d. During the first 14 d , all steers were fed their respective diets ad libitum and during the last 7 d , they were moved to metabolism crates for total urine and fecal collection . It was found that increasing MUP levels resulted in linearly increasing rice straw and total intakes ( p<0.05 ) . Ruminal temperature and pH were not significantly affected by MUP supplementation while NH3-N concentration was increased ( p<0.05 ) and maintained at a high level ( 18.5 mg / dl ) with supplementation of MUP at 600 g / hd / d .

We generated a randomised evaluation design ultimately to clarify whether primary hrHPV testing implemented into routine screening can bring increase in the programme effectiveness . The aim of the present report on first - year results was to assess the cross - sectional relative validity parameters for routine hrHPV screening , in comparison with conventional screening . An equal number of women invited to routine screening was randomly allocated to primary hrHPV screening ( n=7060 ) and to cytological screening ( n=7089 ) . In the hrHPV screening arm , after a single positive hrHPV test result , the need of colposcopy referral was determined by a cytological triage test . Compared with the conventional arm , more colposcopy referrals were made in the hrHPV screening arm ( relative risk 1.51 , confidence interval 95 % 1.03–2.22 ) . Specificity of the primary screening with sole hrHPV test ( 91.5–92.1 % ) was much lower than that with the cytology triage ( 98.7–99.3 % ) , which was not quite as specific as screening with conventional cytology ( 99.2–99.6 % ) . Compared with conventional cytology , primary screening with hrHPV test results in increased cross - sectional relative sensitivity at the level of all positive lesions at the cost of substantial loss in specificity . With cytology triage , the specificity improves to the level of conventional cytology .",gradients,primary hrHPV screening || cytological screening || Specificity,"[(179, 222)]",3,test,gradients

However , pneumoperitoneum can pose risks to the kidneys by causing a decrease in renal blood flow . Furthermore , as in other surgical procedures , laparoscopic bariatric surgery triggers an acute inflammatory response . Neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin is an early and accurate biomarker of renal injury , as well as of the inflammatory response . Anesthetic drugs could offer some protection for the kidneys and could attenuate the acute inflammatory response from surgical trauma . The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two types of anesthetics , propofol and sevoflurane , on the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Sixty - four patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized into two anesthesia groups and were administered either total intravenous anesthesia ( propofol ) or inhalation anesthesia ( sevoflurane ) . In the perioperative period , blood samples were collected at three time points ( before anesthesia , 6 hours after pneumoperitoneum and 24 hours after pneumoperitoneum ) and urine output was measured for 24 hours . Acute kidney injuries were evaluated by examining both the clinical and laboratory parameters during the postoperative period . The differences between the groups were compared using non - parametric tests .

However , there is insufficient evidence supporting use of a simulator . The aim of this study is to determine whether training with medical simulator is associated with faster TT process , compared to conventional training without simulator . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This is a simulation study . Eligible participants were emergency medicine residents with very few ( ≤3 times ) TT experience . Participants were randomized to two groups : the conventional training group , and the simulator training group . While the simulator training group used the simulator to train TT , the conventional training group watched the instructor performing TT on a cadaver . After training , all participants performed a TT on a cadaver . The performance quality was measured as correct placement and time delay . Subjects were graded if they had difficulty on process .

455,4336131_0,4336131,"TITLE : Effects of Rikkunshito ( traditional Japanese medicine ) on enteral feeding and the plasma ghrelin level in critically ill patients : a pilot study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Rikkunshito is a traditional Japanese medicine that has been widely prescribed for patients with various gastrointestinal symptoms . Recently , the prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito in patients with a variety of diseases have attracted attention in Japan . The prokinetic effects of Rikkunshito are believed to result from an increase of active ghrelin , which is most abundant in the stomach and which has a gastrokinetic function . The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effects of Rikkunshito on intragastric enteral feeding and plasma ghrelin levels in critically ill patients . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The study population consisted of critically ill patients who were projected to require intragastric tube feeding for more than 7 days . The patients were prospectively assigned to one of two treatment groups and were randomized to receive either Rikkunshito ( 2.5 g ) or metoclopramide ( 10 mg ) every 8 h. All patients received standard enteral nutrition . Patients in both groups were begun on intragastric tube feeding according to our institution 's feeding protocol .

Consequently , the combination of formoterol and budesonide in one inhaler , approved for maintenance use , can potentially be used for reliever therapy . This study compared the onset of relief from induced bronchospasm with a single dose of budesonide / formoterol versus standard salbutamol therapy in patients with asthma . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In this randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study , 32 patients with asthma underwent a methacholine provocation test leading to a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) of ≥30 % at enrolment ( Visit 1 ) and three subsequent study visits ( Visits 2–4 ) . Immediately after each provocation at Visits 2–4 , patients received one of three test treatments : one inhalation of budesonide / formoterol 160/4.5 μg ( via Turbuhaler ® ) , two inhalations of salbutamol 100 μg ( via a pressurised metered - dose inhaler [ pMDI ] ) or placebo . All patients received each of the test treatments in a randomised order , after separate methacholine provocations . The effect of treatment on FEV1 and breathlessness ( using the Borg scale ) was measured at 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 and 30 minutes after test treatment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Following methacholine provocation , Borg score increased from a baseline value of below 0.5 to 3.03 , 3.31 and 3.50 before treatment with budesonide / formoterol , salbutamol and placebo , respectively . Budesonide / formoterol and salbutamol reversed methacholine - induced dyspnoea ( breathlessness ) rapidly . At 1 minute after inhalation , statistically significant decreases in Borg score were observed for budesonide / formoterol and salbutamol ( p = 0.0233 and p < 0.0001 , respectively , versus placebo ) , with similar rapid increases in FEV1 ( both active treatments p < 0.0001 versus placebo ) .

462,5610004_0,5610004,"TITLE : Development and validation of two prognostic nomograms for predicting survival in patients with non - small cell and small cell lung cancer ABSTRACT.PURPOSE : This study aimed to construct two prognostic nomograms to predict survival in patients with non - small - cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and small - cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) using a novel set of clinical parameters . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : Two nomograms were developed , using a retrospective analysis of 5384 NSCLC and 647 SCLC patients seen during a 10-year period at Xiang Ya Affiliated Cancer Hospital ( Changsha , China ) . The patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts . Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic factors needed to establish nomograms for the training cohort . The model was internally validated via bootstrap resampling and externally certified using the validation cohort . Predictive accuracy and discriminatory capability were estimated using concordance index ( C - index ) , calibration curves , and risk group stratification . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The largest contributor to overall survival ( OS ) prognosis in the NSCLC nomogram was the therapeutic regimen and diagnostic method parameters , and in the SCLC nomogram was the therapeutic regimen and health insurance plan parameters . Calibration curves for the nomogram prediction and the actual observation were in optimal agreement for the 3-year OS and acceptable agreement for the 5-year OS in both training datasets . The C - index was higher for the NSCLC cohort nomogram than for the TNM staging system ( 0.67 vs. 0.64 , P = 0.01 ) and higher for the SCLC nomogram than for the clinical staging system ( limited vs. extensive ) ( 0.60 vs. 0.53 , P = 0.12 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Treatment regimen parameter made the largest contribution to OS prognosis in both nomograms , and these nomograms might provide clinicians and patients a simple tool that improves their ability to accurately estimate survival based on individual patient parameters rather than using an averaged predefined treatment regimen .",scaled attention,Training cohort || Validation cohort || C-index in the NSCLC group,"[(245, 270)]",1,test,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHOD : The subjects in this study included 19 children ( 10 males , 9 females , mean age=8.8 years ) with cerebral palsy . The experimental group ( n=10 ) received CHRIST and general rehabilitation therapy . The control group ( n=9 ) received a home program as well as general rehabilitation therapy . Both groups received 30 sessions of CHRIST or home program training for 60 minutes per session 3 times a week during the 10-week period . The reaching movements were captured by a motion analysis system . Kinematic variables including movement time ( MT ) , mean velocity ( MV ) , normalized jerk score ( NJS ) , mean angular velocity ( MAV ) and normalized jerk score of the shoulder , elbow and wrist joint with comfortable and fast speed were analyzed between groups and the pre - post training group . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After pre- and post - training experimental group , MT , MV , NJS , MAV of shoulder , elbow , wrist and NJS of elbow and wrist improved significantlyin reaching movement of both comfortable and fast speed ( p<0.05 ) . However , After pre- and post - training control group , MV improved significantlyin reaching movement of only comfortable speed ( p<0.05 ) . Between two groups , MT and MAV of the elbow at comfortable speed and NJS of the elbow at fast speed were statisticallysignificant ( p<0.05 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Ten , male swimmers ( 14.9 ± 0.4 years of age ; 63.5 ± 4 kg ) performed four 200 m time trials with the following treatments : acute ( ACU ) supplementation ( 0.5 g kg-1 administered 120 min pre - trial ) , acute placebo ( PLC - A ) , chronic ( CHR ) supplementation ( 0.1 g∙kg-1 for three days and 0.3 g kg-1 on the forth day 120 min pre - trial ) , and chronic placebo ( PLC - C ) . The order of the trials was randomized , with at least a six - day wash - out period between trials . Blood samples were collected by finger prick pre - ingestion , 100 min post - ingestion , and 3 min post - trial .

In vivo studies of these microbicides are critical to confirm safety . Here , we evaluated the impact of a rectal microbicide containing the antiviral lectin , Griffithsin ( GRFT ) , on the rectal mucosal proteome and microbiome . Using a randomized , crossover placebo - controlled design , six rhesus macaques received applications of hydroxyethylcellulose ( HEC)- or carbopol - formulated 0.1 % GRFT gels . Rectal mucosal samples were then evaluated by label - free tandem MS / MS and 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing , for proteomics and microbiome analyses , respectively . Compared to placebo , GRFT gels were not associated with any significant changes to protein levels at any time point ( FDR < 5 % ) , but increased abundances of two common and beneficial microbial taxa after 24 hours were observed in HEC - GRFT gel ( p < 2E-09 ) .

In vivo studies of these microbicides are critical to confirm safety . Here , we evaluated the impact of a rectal microbicide containing the antiviral lectin , Griffithsin ( GRFT ) , on the rectal mucosal proteome and microbiome . Using a randomized , crossover placebo - controlled design , six rhesus macaques received applications of hydroxyethylcellulose ( HEC)- or carbopol - formulated 0.1 % GRFT gels . Rectal mucosal samples were then evaluated by label - free tandem MS / MS and 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing , for proteomics and microbiome analyses , respectively . Compared to placebo , GRFT gels were not associated with any significant changes to protein levels at any time point ( FDR < 5 % ) , but increased abundances of two common and beneficial microbial taxa after 24 hours were observed in HEC - GRFT gel ( p < 2E-09 ) . Compared to baseline , both placebo formulations were associated with alterations to proteins involved in proteolysis , activation of the immune response and inflammation after 2 hours ( p < 0.0001 ) , and increases in beneficial Faecalibacterium spp . after 24 hours in HEC placebo gel ( p = 4.21E-15 ) .

We evaluated the kind of RD expertise that would improve their skills . ABSTRACT.DESIGN , SETTING , PARTICIPANTS , MEASUREMENTS : This study was a post - hoc analysis of our randomized controlled trial , which compared the weight change between participants using the web - based self - disclosure health support and those using the email health support . Healthy men and women aged 35–64 years with a body mass index ( BMI ) of > = 24.5 kg / m2 were recruited for this study . We evaluated the relationship of RD expertise indicators including the duration of working as an RD , the experience of health counseling , and membership in the Japan Dietetic Association ( JDA ) with the weight loss of study participants . The primary endpoint was the change in body weight . Comparison of changes in body weight by the RD expertise indicators was evaluated using analysis of covariance . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : A total of 175 participants were eligible for analyses . Changes in body weight were significantly greater when they were supported by the RDs in the routine counseling group than when supported by the RDs in the non - routine counseling group ( -1.8 kg versus -0.4 kg , fully adjusted P = 0.0089 ) .

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a theory - driven eHealth literacy intervention for older adults . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The experimental design was a 2 × 2 mixed factorial design with learning method ( collaborative ; individualistic ) as the between - participants variable and time of measurement ( pre ; post ) as the within - participants variable . A total of 146 older adults aged 56–91 ( mean 69.99 , SD 8.12 ) participated in this study during February to May 2011 .

The intervention took place at public libraries . Participants were randomly assigned to either experimental condition ( collaborative : n = 72 ; individualistic : n = 74 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Overall , participants ' knowledge , skills , and eHealth literacy efficacy all improved significantly from pre to post intervention ( P < .001 in all cases ; effect sizes were > 0.8 with statistical power of 1.00 even at the .01 level in all cases ) . When controlling for baseline differences , no significant main effect of the learning method was found on computer / Web knowledge , skills , or eHealth literacy efficacy .

However , there is evidence gap regarding the breakup , timing and type of the steroid regimen . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : : Efficacy of three different glucocorticoid regimens having the same total dose of steroid , differing in either the timing or type of evening steroid administered , in achieving biochemical control of the disease was assessed . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The study was done in 13 prepubertal children with classical CAH over a 6-month period with 2 months devoted to each regimen .

516,5483302_0,5483302,"TITLE : Effect of ezetimibe add - on therapy over 52 weeks extension analysis of prospective randomized trial ( RESEARCH study ) in type 2 diabetes subjects ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Lowering cholesterol levels decreases the risk of atherosclerotic diseases . Effective ways to stably reduce LDL - C level are warranted in type 2 diabetic patients , a high - risk population for CVD , with various anti - diabetic therapeutic background . The RESEARCH study focuses on LDL - C reduction in this population along with modifications of the lipid profiles . We evaluated long - term ezetimibe add - on therapy in T2DM patients with hypercholesterolemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , multicenter , open - label , prospective study , a total of 109 T2DM patients not attaining LDL - C target value despite first - line dose statin ( 10 mg of atorvastatin or 1 mg of pitavastatin ) therapy in Japan were recruited . We investigated the difference in cholesterol lowering effect between ezetimibe ( 10 mg ) add - on statin ( EAT ) group and double - dose statin ( DST ) group . Changes of parameters related to atherosclerotic event risks were assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The reduction of LDL - C was larger in the EAT group ( 28.3 % ) than in the DST group ( 9.2 % ) at 52 weeks as well as the primary endpoint of 12 weeks . EAT achieved significant lower levels of TC and apo B , respectively . Both treatments attained significant reduction in sd - LDL - C or hsCRP on this long - term basis . Notably , sd - LDL - C in EAT reduced as low as 36.1 ± 14.9 mg / dl to reach near the threshold ( 35.0 mg / dl ) for atherosclerosis with significantly higher achievement rate ( 55.6 % ) than DST treatment . Simultaneously , hsCRP reduction by EAT attained as low value as 0.52 ± 0.43 mg / l . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In the present 52-week long - term period , ezetimibe add - on therapy showed a robust advantage in lowering LDL - C and in attaining target LDL - C values compared with the doubling of statin dose . Moreover , it 's meaningful that sd - LDL , powerfully atherogenic lipoprotein , exhibited prominent decrease consistently prominently by ezetimibe add - on therapy . DM patients with hypercholesterolemia are at high risk for CAD , and adding ezetimibe onto usual - dose statin treatment in Japan has been suggested as the first - line therapy for those DM patients who failed to attain the target LDL - C value ( UMIN000002593 ) .",scaled attention,ezetimibe (10 mg) add-on statin (EAT) || double-dose statin (DST) || Small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sd-LDL-C) level at 52wks,"[(204, 232)]",1,test,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Data were collected from 48 participants in the following demographically matched groups : patients with chronic pain ( n=36 ) and healthy controls ( n=12 ) . Participants underwent a series of Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) procedures assessing responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli during two separate visits , in a randomized order . One visit consisted of standard , moderately painful QST procedures , while the other visit involved nonpainful analogs to these testing procedures . Blood samples were taken at baseline , and then for up to 2 hours after QST in order to study the time course of IL-6 responses . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Results of multilevel analyses revealed that IL-6 responses increased across assessment time points in both visits ( p<0.001 ) . While patients with chronic pain and healthy controls did not differ in the magnitude of IL-6 responses , psychological factors influenced IL-6 trajectories only in the chronic pain group . Among patients , increases in catastrophizing over the course of the QST session were associated with elevated IL-6 responses only during the painful QST session ( p<0.05 ) . When controlling for anxiety , results indicated that the main multilevel model among patients remained significant ( p<0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Under specific conditions ( eg , application of a painful stressor ) , catastrophizing may be associated with amplified proinflammatory responses in patients with persistent pain . These findings suggest that psychosocial interventions that reduce negative pain - related cognitions may benefit patients ' inflammatory profiles .",ig,moderately painful Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) procedures || baseline || IL-6 responses,"[(212, 238)]",5,test,ig

Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were calculated from epinephrine plasma concentrations and hemodynamic parameters . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Mean exposure to epinephrine decreased from the 8 mg dose to the 4 mg inhalative dose , and further with the 0.3 mg intramuscular dose , with active treatments showing significantly higher concentrations than placebo ( geometric mean area under the curve AUC0-t(last ) values : 282 , 236 , 204 and 81.6 hr*ng / L ) . Maximal concentrations were reached within approximately 15 min for all active treatments . Epinephrine effects for inhalative administrations on heart rates were significantly higher than those for the intramuscular or placebo administration , while no excessive effects occurred . Pronounced overall variability prohibited a definite assessment of relative bioavailability between treatments . However , results indicated that epinephrine concentrations obtained following the 8 mg inhalative dose were not inferior to those after 0.3 mg i.m . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : A relevant fraction of moist inhalation epinephrine doses is absorbed and mediates systemic effects . This suggests that administration of epinephrine via a suitable pocket inhaler device may be beneficial in ambulatory emergency treatment of systemic hypersensitivity reactions .

To throw light on this situation , we studied the effects of consuming Spanish dry - cured ham on platelet function , monocyte activation markers and the inflammatory status of healthy humans with pre - hypertension . Methods : Thirty - eight healthy volunteers with systolic blood pressure of > 125 mmHg were enrolled in a two - arm crossover randomized controlled trial . Participants received 80 g / day dry - cured pork ham of > 11 months proteolysis or 100 g / day cooked ham ( control product ) for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week washout before "" crossing over "" to the other treatment for 4 more weeks . Soluble markers and cytokines were analyzed by ELISA . Platelet function was assessed by measuring P - selectin expression and PAC-1 binding after ADP ( adenosine diphosphate ) stimulation using whole blood flow cytometry . Monocyte markers of the pathological status ( adhesion , inflammatory and scavenging receptors ) were also measured by flow cytometry in the three monocyte subsets after the interventional period . Results : The mean differences between dry - cured ham and cooked ham followed by a time period adjustment for plasmatic P - selectin and interleukin 6 proteins slightly failed ( p = 0.062 and p = 0.049 , respectively ) , notably increased for MCP-1 levels ( p = 0.023 ) while VCAM-1 was not affected . Platelet function also decreased after ADP stimulation . The expression of adhesion and scavenging markers ( ICAM1R , CXCR4 and TLR4 ) in the three subsets of monocytes was significantly higher ( all p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The regular consumption of biopeptides contained in the dry - cured ham but absent in cooked ham impaired platelet and monocyte activation and the levels of plasmatic P - selectin , MCP-1 and interleukin 6 in healthy subjects . This study strongly suggests the existence of a mechanism that links dietary biopeptides and beneficial health effects .",attention,Dry-cured ham || Cooked ham || Vascular cell adhesion protein 1,"[(272, 287)]",0,test,attention

534,4520847_0,4520847,"TITLE : Does elevated intra - abdominal pressure during laparoscopic colorectal surgery cause acute gastrointestinal injury ? ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : The incidence of acute gastrointestinal injury ( AGI ) after colorectal surgery is low when laparoscopic techniques are used . While elevated intra - abdominal pressure ( IAP ) and intra - abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) are associated with AGI grade II , little is known about the relation between increased IAP during laparoscopy and subsequent AGI . ABSTRACT.AIM : To assess the impact of increased IAP during laparoscopic colorectal surgery on the incidence of postoperative AGI . ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS : Sixty - six patients ( 41 men and 25 women ) with colorectal cancer undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery were randomized into 3 groups , according to different IAP levels during CO2 pneumoperitoneum ( 10 mm Hg , 12 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg ) . We recorded the incidence of AGI after surgery by assessing the following parameters : time to first flatus / defecation , time to first bowel movement , time to tolerance of semi - liquid food and the occurrence of vomiting / diarrhea . Moreover , inflammatory mediators were measured before the induction of CO2 pneumoperitoneum and on postoperative day 1 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Acute gastrointestinal injury occurred in 15 ( 27.3 % ) patients . In all 3 study groups , the elevation of IAP during CO2 pneumoperitoneum did not significantly increase the occurrence of symptoms of AGI , vomiting or diarrhea . Lower IAP levels did not significantly accelerate recovery of gastrointestinal function or shorten postoperative hospital stay . The changes in serum IL-6 after surgery did not correlate with the value of IAP . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The level of IAP elevation during laparoscopic colorectal surgery does not increase the occurrence of AGI after surgery .",attention,"CO2 pneumoperitoneum -10 mm Hg, 12 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg). || CO2 pneumoperitoneum - 15 mm Hg). || increase in IL-6 levels","[(269, 285)]",0,test,attention

Nutrition may affect acid – base balance and further physical performance . With the help of PRAL ( potential renal acid load ) , a low - protein vegetarian diet ( LPVD ) was designed to enhance the production of bases in body . The aim of this study was to investigate if LPVD has an effect on blood acid – base status and performance during submaximal and maximal aerobic cycling . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Nine healthy , recreationally active men ( age 23.5 ± 3.4 yr ) participated in the study and were randomly divided into two groups in a cross - over study design . Group 1 followed LPVD for 4 days and group 2 ate normally ( ND ) before performing a cycle ergometer test . The test included three 10-min stages at 40 , 60 and 80 % of VO2max . The fourth stage was performed at 100 % of VO2max until exhaustion . After 10–16 days , the groups started a second 4-day diet , and at the end performed the similar ergometer test .

Because of a high predictive value of rapid virological response ( RVR ) for sustained virological response ( SVR ) , we conducted an open - label randomized controlled trial to compare 24- and 48-week peginterferon / ribavirin combination therapy for patients with HCV genotype 6 in Southern China who achieved an RVR . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : Treatment - naive , non - cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 were treated with pegylated interferon α-2a ( 180 μg / week ) and ribavirin ( 800–1,200 mg , according to weight ) for 4 weeks . Patients who achieved an RVR , which was defined as HCV RNA negativity at week 4 ( < 50 IU ) , were randomized to receive either an additional 20 or 44 weeks of treatment ( 24- and 48-week treatment groups , respectively ) . The primary outcome measure was SVR . From January 2011 to June 2014 , 152(152/210 , 72.4 % ) patients with HCV genotype 6a and RVR were randomized 1:1 to the 24- or 48-week treatment group . The SVR rates in the 24- and 48-week groups in the intention - to - treat analysis were 90.8 % ( 69/76 ) and 88.2 % ( 67/76 ) , respectively ; those in the per - protocol analysis were 95.7 % ( 67/70 ) and 97.0 % ( 64/66 ) , respectively . More patients in the 48-week group had anemia ( 46.1 % vs. 28.9 % , P = 0.03 ) , but other adverse events were comparable between the groups . The limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled which may inhibit the extensive application of the findings . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Twenty - four weeks of peginterferon / ribavirin combination therapy was non - inferior to 48 weeks in patients with HCV genotype 6a in Southern China who achieved an RVR .

558,4107254_0,4107254,"TITLE : A survey to establish current methods of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in stroke patients practiced by Polish neurologists ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in stroke patients . The purpose of our survey was to establish the current methods of VTE prophylaxis practiced by Polish neurologists . We also aimed to determine whether there is enough variation in practice to justify the development of an evidence - based guideline for VTE prevention . ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS : Postal self - administered questionnaires about VTE prophylactic methods practiced by Polish neurologists were sent to 218 neurological wards where stroke is treated . If no response was received , the questionnaire was faxed and finally we attempted to obtain information by telephone . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : One hundred and seventy - six ( 80.7 % ) stroke centers of 218 responded . The majority ( 137/176 ; 77.8 % ) of centers had a stroke unit . The median admission rate of surveyed wards was estimated to be 320 patients / year ( range from 20 to 1000 patients / year ) . The most common method of VTE prophylaxis reported was low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) ( 98.9 % ) , and the least common was intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) ( 6.8 % ) . Centers admitting ≥ 200 patients / year ( 70.7 % vs. 45 % ; p = 0.039 ) , and those with stroke units ( 95 vs. 20 ; p = 0.031 ) were more willing to join a randomized trial evaluating any of the methods . All the centers participating in the survey reported a need for a detailed VTE prophylaxis guidelines . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The LMWH is the predominant VTE prophylaxis strategy for stroke patients practiced by Polish neurologists . Due to the variation of methods used in VTE prophylaxis it might be reasonable to further specify this section of stroke treatment guidelines .",attention,centers with stroke unit || centers without stroke unit || willing to join a randomized trial evaluating any of the methods used in VTE prophylaxis in stroke patients,"[(226, 273)]",0,test,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : We carried out a randomized controlled trial , studying 106 veterans with SCI from three Veterans Affairs rehabilitation centers . Each participant received either five one - on - one WSTP or EC sessions 30–45 minutes in duration . The main outcome measures were the total and subtotal percentage capacity scores from the Wheelchair Skills Test 4.1 ( WST ) and Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique ( CHART ) scores . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Participants in the WSTP group improved their total and Advanced - level WST scores by 7.1 % and 30.1 % relative to baseline ( p < 0.001 ) and retained their scores at one year follow - up . The success rates for individual skills were consistent with the total and subtotal WST scores . The CHART Mobility sub - score improved by 3.2 % over baseline ( p = 0.021 ) .

566,5835896_0,5835896,"TITLE : Multicenter , phase II clinical trial of peptide vaccination with oral chemotherapy following curative resection for stage III colorectal cancer ABSTRACT : The safety and immunological responsiveness of a peptide vaccine of ring finger protein 43 and 34-kDa translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane combined with uracil - tegafur / leucovorin ( UFT / LV ) was previously demonstrated in metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) in a phase I clinical trial . To clarify the survival benefit of a peptide vaccine combined with UFT / LV as adjuvant treatment , a phase II clinical trial was conducted involving patients with stage III CRC . All enrolled patients , whose human leukocyte antigen ( HLA)-A status was double - blinded , were administered the same regime of a peptide vaccine and UFT / LV chemotherapy . The primary objective of the study was to compare relapse - free survival ( RFS ) in patients with HLA - A*2402 vs. those without HLA - A*2402 . Secondary objectives included comparisons between the two groups regarding overall survival , safety , tolerability and peptide - specific activities of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) as measured by the ELISPOT assay . Between December 2009 and December 2014 , a total of 46 patients were enrolled to the present study . Three - year RFS was not significantly different between HLA - A*2402 matched and unmatched groups [ 67.8 vs. 73.6 % , respectively ; hazard ratio ( HR)=1.254 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.48–4.63 ; P=0.706 ] .

In conclusion , vaccination - induced immune responses combined with UFT / LV were positively associated with survival benefit in patients with HLA - A*2402-positive stage III CRC .

Overall , treatment success was significantly lower in ICU subjects compared with non - ICU subjects ( 64.3 % ( n = 148/230 ) versus 78.3 % ( n = 206/263 ) ; P = 0.0006 ) . Multivariate regression analysis revealed a lower likelihood of treatment success for : ICU versus non - ICU subjects ; persistent neutropenia ; and high versus low Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II scores . However , when interactions between potential explanatory factors were included in the analysis model , ICU status no longer emerged as a significant associated variable but the association between APACHE II score and treatment outcome remained . Further analyses indicated that the likelihood of mortality at day 8 and day 30 was lower for subjects with lower APACHE II scores . Renal function was significantly better in micafungin versus liposomal amphotericin B subjects : a difference ( liposomal amphotericin B - micafungin in mean peak change in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( ml / minute/1.73 m2 ) of -18.2 ( P < 0.0001 ) and -17.7 ( P = 0.0124 ) in non - ICU and ICU subjects , respectively . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Overall , ICU subjects had lower treatment success rates than non - ICU subjects for both liposomal amphotericin B and micafungin . Multivariate regression after controlling for potential confounding factors suggested the APACHE II score remained a potential explanatory factor associated with treatment success , mortality at day 8 , and mortality at day 30 .

In addition , these premedicants significantly modulate not only the intraoperative requirements of the anesthetic agents , but also the postoperative outcome . We aim to compare the efficacy of both the agents in view of premedication , induction characteristics , hemodynamic changes and postoperative complications utilizing bispectral index ( BIS ) using propofol anesthesia . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The type of this study was randomized control trial conducted on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation . Study included 105 patients of either sex aged 20 - 60 years . The patients were randomly allocated into three groups : Intravenous midazolam ( Group 1 ) , clonidine ( Group 2 ) , and normal saline ( Group 3 ) ( control ) . The initial value of BIS and Ramsay Sedation Score , dose of propofol required for induction were noted in each group and monitored for pulse rate , electrocardiograph , noninvasive blood pressure , and BIS . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The requirement of propofol ranged from 40 to 150 mg . Mean requirement was maximum in Group 3 ( 109.43 ± 20.14 mg ) and it was minimum in Group 1 ( 78.57 ± 22.15 mg ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : Two Phase III , placebo - controlled , double - masked , randomized clinical trials were conducted at a total of six separate centers using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis . The same study design was employed for both clinical trials , with subjects randomly assigned to either BBOS 1.5 % ( n=78 ) or placebo ( n=79 ) treatment . Each subject received one eye drop of the test agent bilaterally at different study visits 15 minutes , 8 hours , or 16 hours prior to a CAC . Primary ocular end points included changes in ocular itching reported at 3 , 5 , and 7 minutes and conjunctival hyperemia assessed at 7 , 15 , and 20 minutes following each CAC . Secondary ocular end points included chemosis as well as episcleral and ciliary hyperemia judged by investigators , and tearing ( scored as either absent or present ) and eyelid swelling judged by subjects . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : A statistically significant reduction in ocular itching was observed for BBOS 1.5 % treatment compared to placebo at all time points ( P<0.0001 ) , while measures for onset and 8-hour persistence of action also reached clinical significance ( ie , ≥1.0 unit difference ) at a majority of time points . In addition , a significant reduction in conjunctival hyperemia was achieved at a majority of time points during the onset of action CAC test . Secondary end points were also significantly improved compared to placebo , most prominently for reduced tearing at all study visits and reduced eyelid swelling at the onset of action and 8-hour study visits . Adverse events were generally mild and transient . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : BBOS 1.5 % rapidly reduced CAC - induced ocular itching with duration of effectiveness of at least 8 hours after dosing . Certain secondary signs of inflammation were also significantly reduced .",lime,bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution (BBOS) 1.5% || placebo || ocular itching,"[(214, 238)]",2,test,lime

This study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial of a skin cancer intervention in which participants ( n = 312 ) had a full - body skin examination by a clinician and received a presumptive diagnosis ( abnormal finding , no abnormal finding ) . Participants ' pursuit of follow - up was assessed post - intervention ( n = 283 ) . Analyses examined : ( 1 ) participant 's recall of screening results ; and ( 2 ) whether cognitive and behavioral variables were associated with follow - up being as advised . Just 12 % of participants ( 36/312 ) did not correctly recall the results of their skin examination . One - third ( 33 % , 93/283 ) of participants ' follow - up was classified as being not as advised ( recommend follow - up not pursued , unadvised follow - up pursued ) . Among participants whose follow - up was not as advised , 71 % ( 66/93 ) did not seek recommended care . None of the measured behavioral and cognitive variables were significantly associated with recall of screening examination results or whether follow - up was as advised .

620,4889193_0,4889193,"TITLE : Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Initiation and Dose Uptitration in Children With Cardiovascular Disease : A Retrospective Review of Standard Clinical Practice and a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) are a mainstay of medical management in pediatric cardiology . However , there are no data defining how best to initiate and uptitrate the dose of these medications in children . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS : Retrospective chart review revealed only 24 % of our pediatric cardiology inpatients were discharged on predefined optimal doses of ACEIs and few underwent further dose uptitration in the 8 weeks after hospital discharge . Therefore , 2 alternative protocols for initiation of captopril were compared in a prospective randomized clinical trial . A "" rapid uptitration "" protocol reached an optimal dose on day 3 , whereas the alternative , "" prolonged uptitration "" protocol , reached an optimal dose on day 9 . Forty‐6 patients ( 54 % male ) were recruited to the trial , with a median age of 0.7 year ( IQR 0.5–2.3 years ) . Captopril was initiated while in intensive care in 39 % of patients and on the cardiology ward in 61 % . There were no differences between the protocols in episodes of hypotension , symptomatic hypotension , or indices of renal function . Patients following the rapid protocol reached higher doses of captopril ( 0.93±0.24 versus 0.57±0.38 mg / kg per dose , P<0.0001 ) and were more likely to have achieved the predefined target ( 88 % versus 43 % , P=0.002 ) and optimal ACEI doses ( 80 % versus 29 % , P=0.001 ) before discharge . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : A protocol of rapid ACEI dose uptitration for infants and children with cardiovascular disease can be introduced safely , even in patients receiving intensive care therapy . Compared with standard clinical practice or with a more prolonged protocol , rapid ACEI dose uptitration achieves a higher dosage in this population with no evident disadvantages .

We examined the effects of two group - based HIV prevention interventions that engaged men and their female partners together in a couples intervention ( Couples Health CoOp [ CHC ] ) and a gender - separate intervention ( Men 's Health CoOp / Women 's Health CoOp [ MHC / WHC ] ) on women 's reports of power , communication , and conflict in relationships . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The cluster - randomized field experiment included heterosexual couples from a high - density South African township in which neighborhoods were randomized to one of the intervention arms or a control arm that received the WHC only . Participants completed in - person study visits at baseline and 6-month follow - up . We examined group differences using one - way analysis of variance and multivariable regression models . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 290 couples enrolled , 255 women remained in the same partnership over 6 months .

634,2723123_0,2723123,"TITLE : Effect of a 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste and a 250 ppm fluoride mouth rinse on the demineralisation of dentin surfaces ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The purpose of this study was to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the effect of ( 1 ) a 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste , and ( 2 ) a 250 ppm fluoride mouth rinse on demineralized human dentin surfaces , against the alternative hypothesis of a difference . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : Dentin specimens were obtained from the cervical regions of 45 extracted human third molars . Half the surface of each specimen was sealed with a self - etching adhesive system and served as the reference surface . The dentin specimens were randomly assigned to one of the three groups , 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste ( Duraphat ) , 250 ppm fluoride mouth rinse ( Meridol ) and distilled water ( negative control ) . An intraoral appliance was made for one volunteer . In each test cycle , 15 specimens were inserted in the appliance and worn for 24 hours a day , over a period of three weeks . Once daily , the appliance was immersed in the agent being tested ; either toothpaste slurry , mouth rinse or distilled water for 60 seconds . Demineralization was assessed in terms of lesion depth ( μm ) and mineral loss ( vol . % × μm ) by transversal microradiography .

This study was aimed to evaluate the role of late TAM in these patients . ABSTRACT.METHODS : From 1997 to 2003 , patients aged 35 to 75 years , operated more than 2 years previously for monolateral breast cancer without adjuvant TAM , with no signs of metastases and no contraindication to TAM were randomized to TAM 20 mg / day orally for 2 years or follow - up alone . Events were categorized as locoregional relapse , distant metastases , metachronous breast cancer , tumours other than breast cancer and death from any causes , whichever occurred first . The sample size ( 197 patients per arm , plus 10 % allowance ) was based on the assumption of a 30 % decrease in the number of events occurring at a rate of 5 % annually in the 10 years following randomization . Four hundred and thirty - three patients were randomized in the study ( TAM 217 , follow - up 216 ) . Patients characteristics ( TAM / follow - up ) included : median age 55/55 years , median time from surgery 25/25 months ( range , 25 - 288/25 - 294 ) , in situ carcinoma 18/24 , oestrogen receptor ( ER ) positive in 75/68 , negative in 70/57 , unknown in 72/91 patients . Previous adjuvant treatment included chemotherapy in 131/120 and an LHRH analogue in 11/13 patients . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Thirty - six patients prematurely discontinued TAM after a median of 1 month , mostly because of subjective intolerance . Eighty - three events ( TAM 39 , follow - up 44 ) occurred : locoregional relapse in 10/8 , distant metastases in 14/16 , metachronous breast cancer in 4/10 , other tumours in 11/10 patients . Less ER - positive secondary breast cancers occurred in the TAM treated patients than in follow - up patients ( 1 vs 10 , p = 0.005 ) . Event - free survival was similar in both groups of patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This 5-year analysis revealed significantly less metachronous ER - positive breast cancers in the TAM treated patients .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was a randomized , two - period crossover open - label study in symptomatic patients with COPD [ age 40 years or older , postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) of 70 % or less and 50 % or more of predicted normal values , and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score of 2 or greater ] not receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy . Patients were randomized to receive UMEC / VI ( 62.5/25 μg once daily ) via a multidose dry powder inhaler ( ELLIPTA ) followed by TIO / OLO ( 5/5 μg once daily ) via a soft mist inhaler ( Respimat ) , each for 8 weeks with an interim 3-week washout or vice versa . The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 with a noninferiority margin of − 50 mL in the per - protocol ( PP ) population . The incidence of adverse events was also assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In total , 236 patients ( mean age 64.4 years , 60 % male ) were included in the intent - to - treat population and 227 were included in the PP population . UMEC / VI treatment was noninferior in the PP population and superior in the intent - to - treat population to TIO / OLO treatment with regard to trough FEV1 at week 8 [ FEV1 change from baseline 180 mL vs 128 mL ; difference 52 mL ( 95 % confidence interval 28–77 mL ) ; p < 0.001 ] . Patients receiving UMEC / VI had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase ( 100 mL or more ) from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 compared with patients receiving TIO / OLO ( odds ratio 2.05 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.34–3.14 ) . Adverse events occurred in 25 % of patients in the UMEC / VI group and in 31 % of patients in the TIO / OLO group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : In this first direct comparison of two once - daily fixed - dose LAMA / LABA combinations , superiority was observed for the primary end point of trough FEV1 at week 8 with UMEC / VI compared with TIO / OLO in patients with symptomatic COPD . Both treatments had similar safety profiles . These findings confirm the results of previous indirect LAMA / LABA comparisons , and show that an efficacy gradient exists within the LAMA / LABA class .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was a randomized , two - period crossover open - label study in symptomatic patients with COPD [ age 40 years or older , postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1 ) of 70 % or less and 50 % or more of predicted normal values , and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score of 2 or greater ] not receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy . Patients were randomized to receive UMEC / VI ( 62.5/25 μg once daily ) via a multidose dry powder inhaler ( ELLIPTA ) followed by TIO / OLO ( 5/5 μg once daily ) via a soft mist inhaler ( Respimat ) , each for 8 weeks with an interim 3-week washout or vice versa . The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 with a noninferiority margin of − 50 mL in the per - protocol ( PP ) population . The incidence of adverse events was also assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In total , 236 patients ( mean age 64.4 years , 60 % male ) were included in the intent - to - treat population and 227 were included in the PP population . UMEC / VI treatment was noninferior in the PP population and superior in the intent - to - treat population to TIO / OLO treatment with regard to trough FEV1 at week 8 [ FEV1 change from baseline 180 mL vs 128 mL ; difference 52 mL ( 95 % confidence interval 28–77 mL ) ; p < 0.001 ] . Patients receiving UMEC / VI had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase ( 100 mL or more ) from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 8 compared with patients receiving TIO / OLO ( odds ratio 2.05 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.34–3.14 ) . Adverse events occurred in 25 % of patients in the UMEC / VI group and in 31 % of patients in the TIO / OLO group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : In this first direct comparison of two once - daily fixed - dose LAMA / LABA combinations , superiority was observed for the primary end point of trough FEV1 at week 8 with UMEC / VI compared with TIO / OLO in patients with symptomatic COPD . Both treatments had similar safety profiles . These findings confirm the results of previous indirect LAMA / LABA comparisons , and show that an efficacy gradient exists within the LAMA / LABA class .

This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study — a phase III , randomized , open - label , controlled study ( N = 676)—to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin , a LMWH , versus vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) for prevention of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 60 ml / min ) .

655,4779585_0,4779585,"TITLE : Protein intake ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Training camps for top - class endurance athletes place high physiological demands on the body . Focus on optimizing recovery between training sessions is necessary to minimize the risk of injuries and improve adaptations to the training stimuli . Carbohydrate supplementation during sessions is generally accepted as being beneficial to aid performance and recovery , whereas the effect of protein supplementation and timing is less well understood . We studied the effects of protein ingestion during training sessions on performance and recovery of elite cyclists during a strenuous training camp . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blinded study , 18 elite cyclists consumed either a whey protein hydrolysate - carbohydrate beverage ( PRO - CHO , 14 g protein / h and 69 g CHO / h ) or an isocaloric carbohydrate beverage ( CHO , 84 g / h ) during each training session for six days ( 25–29 h cycling in total ) . Diet and training were standardized and supervised . The diet was energy balanced and contained 1.7 g protein / kg / day . A 10-s peak power test and a 5-min all - out performance test were conducted before and after the first training session and repeated at day 6 of the camp . Blood and saliva samples were collected in the morning after overnight fasting during the week and analyzed for biochemical markers of muscle damage , stress , and immune function . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In both groups , 5-min all - out performance was reduced after the first training session and at day 6 compared to before the first training session , with no difference between groups . Peak power in the sprint test did not change significantly between tests or between groups . In addition , changes in markers for muscle damage , stress , and immune function were not significantly influenced by treatment . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intake of protein combined with carbohydrate during cycling at a training camp for top cyclists did not result in marked performance benefits compared to intake of carbohydrates when a recovery drink containing adequate protein and carbohydrate was ingested immediately after each training session in both groups . These findings suggest that the addition of protein to a carbohydrate supplement consumed during exercise does not improve recovery or performance in elite cyclists despite high demands of daily exhaustive sessions during a one - week training camp .",scaled attention,Whey protein hydrolysate-carbohydrate beverage || Isocaloric carbohydrate beverage || Muscle damage,"[(301, 323)]",1,test,scaled attention

Pearson 's correlation coefficient between FA and UA systolic BP ( SBP ) measured by mercury was 0.782 , and for diastolic BP ( DBP ) it was 0.824 . Similarly , Pearson 's correlation coefficient between FA and UA SBP measured with an automated device ( OMRON ) was 0.843 , and for DBP it was 0.846 . The average readings for the SBP and DBP were higher in the FA than in the UA by approximately 3 mmHg . There was a statistically significant difference in both SBP and DBP . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : The FA is an acceptable method of BP monitoring when the UA can not be accessed . The pressure from FA is probably higher than it would be from UA .",scaled attention,Measuring BPs in the forearm (FA) || Measuring BPs in the upper arm (UA) || The average readings for the SBP and DBP,"[(230, 264)]",1,test,scaled attention
675,4296355_0,4296355,"TITLE : Efficacy of clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block : A prospective study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS : : Bupivacaine has been the most frequently used local anaesthetic in brachial plexus block , but ropivacaine has also been successfully tried in the recent past . It is less cardiotoxic , less arrhythmogenic , less toxic to the central nervous system than bupivacaine , and it has intrinsic vasoconstrictor property . The effects of clonidine have been studied in peripheral nerve blockade . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of clonidine on nerve blockade during brachial plexus block with ropivacaine using peripheral nerve stimulator . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups , Group A and B. Group A received 30 ml of 0.5 % of ropivacaine with 0.5 ml normal saline while Group B received same amount of ropivacaine with 0.5 ml ( equivalent to 75 μg ) of clonidine for supraclavicular brachial plexus block . The groups were compared regarding quality of sensory and motor blockade , duration of post - operative analgesia and intra and post - operative complications . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There was a significant increase in duration of motor and sensory block and analgesia in Group B as compared to Group A patients ( P < 0.0001 ) . There was no significant difference in onset time in either group ( P = 0.304 ) . No significant side effects were noted .

690,4513485_0,4513485,"TITLE : Barriers to uptake among high - risk individuals declining participation in lung cancer screening : a mixed methods analysis of the UK Lung Cancer Screening ( UKLS ) trial ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : The current study aimed to identify the barriers to participation among high - risk individuals in the UK Lung Cancer Screening ( UKLS ) pilot trial . ABSTRACT.SETTING : The UKLS pilot trial is a randomised controlled trial of low - dose CT ( LDCT ) screening that has recruited high - risk people using a population approach in the Cambridge and Liverpool areas . ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS : High - risk individuals aged 50–75 years were invited to participate in UKLS . Individuals were excluded if a LDCT scan was performed within the last year , if they were unable to provide consent , or if LDCT screening was unable to be carried out due to coexisting comorbidities . ABSTRACT.OUTCOME MEASURES : Statistical associations between individual characteristics and UKLS uptake were examined using multivariable regression modelling . In those who completed a non - participation questionnaire ( NPQ ) , thematic analysis of free - text data was undertaken to identify reasons for not taking part , with subsequent exploratory linkage of key themes to risk factors for non - uptake . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Comparative data were available from 4061 high - risk individuals who consented to participate in the trial and 2756 who declined participation . Of those declining participation , 748 ( 27.1 % ) completed a NPQ . Factors associated with non - uptake included : female gender ( OR=0.64 , p<0.001 ) , older age ( OR=0.73 , p<0.001 ) , current smoking ( OR=0.70 , p<0.001 ) , lower socioeconomic group ( OR=0.56 , p<0.001 ) and higher affective risk perception ( OR=0.52 , p<0.001 ) . Among non - participants who provided a reason , two main themes emerged reflecting practical and emotional barriers . Smokers were more likely to report emotional barriers to participation . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : A profile of risk factors for non - participation in lung screening has emerged , with underlying reasons largely relating to practical and emotional barriers .

Our objective in this study was to explore the functional neuromodulatory potential of tsDCS by examining its immediate and lasting effects over the repeated performance of a whole body maximal exercise in healthy volunteers . Using a double - blind , randomized , crossover , sham - controlled design we investigated the effects of 15 min of anodal tsDCS on repeated vertical countermovement jump ( VCJ ) performance at 0 , 20 , 60 , and 180 minutes post - stimulation . Measurements of peak and take - off velocity , vertical displacement , peak power and work done during countermovement and push - off VCJ phases were derived from changes in vertical ground reaction force ( 12 performance parameters ) in 12 healthy participants . The magnitude and direction of change in VCJ performance from pre- to post - stimulation differed significantly between sham and active tsDCS for 7 of the 12 VCJ performance measures ( P < 0.05 ) . These differences comprised of a post - sham fatigue in VCJ displacement / work done , peak to peak power and take - off velocity , and a resilience to this fatigue effect post - active tsDCS . In addition there was also an enhancement of countermovement performance and total work done ( P < 0.05 ) . These changes did not vary across repeated VCJ performances over time post - tsDCS ( P > 0.05 ) . Our original findings demonstrate that one single session of anodal tsDCS in healthy subjects can prevent fatigue and maintain or enhance different aspects of whole body explosive motor power over repeated sets of VCJs performed over a period of three hours . The observed effects are discussed in relation to alterations in central fatigue mechanisms , muscle contraction mode during jump execution and changes in spinal cord excitability . These findings have important implications for power endurance sport performance and for neuromotor rehabilitation .",attention,Active anodal tsDCS || Sham tsDCS || Countermovement velocity,"[(253, 270)]",0,test,attention

The present study aims to test this hypothesis using data from the Food4Me study . This was a 6-month Internet - based randomised controlled trial conducted across seven centres in Europe where individuals received either general healthy eating advice or varying levels of personalised nutrition advice . Participants who received genotype - based personalised advice were informed whether they had the risk ( CT / TT ) ( n = 178 ) or non - risk ( CC ) ( n = 141 ) alleles of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene in relation to cardiovascular health and the importance of a sufficient intake of folate . General linear model analysis was used to assess changes in folate intake between the MTHFR risk , MTHFR non - risk and control groups from baseline to month 6 of the intervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There were no differences between the groups for age , gender or BMI . However , there was a significant difference in country distribution between the groups ( p = 0.010 ) . Baseline folate intakes were 412 ± 172 , 391 ± 190 and 410 ± 186 μg per 10 MJ for the risk , non - risk and control groups , respectively . There were no significant differences between the three groups in terms of changes in folate intakes from baseline to month 6 . Similarly , there were no changes in reported intake of food groups high in folate . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that knowledge of MTHFR 677C → T genotype did not improve folate intake in participants with the risk variant compared with those with the non - risk variant .

694,4161265_0,4161265,"TITLE : Central effects of acetylsalicylic acid on trigeminal - nociceptive stimuli ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Acetylsalicylic acid is one of the most used analgesics to treat an acute migraine attack . Next to the inhibitory effects on peripheral prostaglandin synthesis , central mechanisms of action have also been discussed . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Using a standardized model for trigeminal - nociceptive stimulation during fMRI scanning , we investigated the effect of acetylsalicylic acid on acute pain compared to saline in 22 healthy volunteers in a double - blind within - subject design . Painful stimulation was applied using gaseous ammonia and presented in a pseudo - randomized order with several control stimuli . All participants were instructed to rate the intensity and unpleasantness of every stimulus on a VAS scale . Based on previous results , we hypothesized to find an effect of ASA on central pain processing structures like the ACC , SI and SII as well as the trigeminal nuclei and the hypothalamus . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Even though we did not find any differences in pain ratings between saline and ASA , we observed decreased BOLD signal changes in response to trigemino - nociceptive stimulation in the ACC and SII after administration of ASA compared to saline . This finding is in line with earlier imaging results investigating the effect of ASA on acute pain . Contrary to earlier findings from animal studies , we could not find an effect of ASA on the trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem or within the hypothalamic area . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Taken together our study replicates earlier findings of an attenuating effect of ASA on pain processing structures , which adds further evidence to a possibly central mechanism of action of ASA .",scaled attention,Acetylsalicylic acid || saline || activity of the hypothalamic area or the trigeminal nuclei,"[(234, 255)]",1,test,scaled attention

Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas - chromatography mass spectrometry , muscle phosphorylation of p70S6 K , 4E – BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting , and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [ 2H5]phenylalanine - infusion , gas - chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope - ratio mass spectrometry . Being the main comparison , differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one - way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two - way ANOVA . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk ( P < 0.05 ) . Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6 K than milk 180 min after exercise ( P = 0.03 ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1–3 h hours after exercise with WPC-80 ( 0.119 % ) , and 1–5 h after exercise with native whey ( 0.112 % ) . Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1–5 h after exercise with native whey than with milk ( 0.112 % vs. 0.064 , P = 0.023 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Despite higher - magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey , it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6 K during a 5-h post - exercise period .

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The data presented in this investigation indicate that late postconditioning with the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane might mediate cardiac protection , even with a late , brief , and low - dose application .
