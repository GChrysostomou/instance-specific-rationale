425,2912679_1,2912679,"TITLE : Open Labeled , Randomized , Switch - Over Study of Two Fixed Doses ( 10/15 mg ) Of Aripiprazole : To Evaluate its Safety And Efficacy in the Treatment of Indian Patients of Schizophrenia . ABSTRACT : Aripiprazole is a new anti psychotic with a unique receptor binding profile that combines partial agonistic activity at D2 receptor and 5-HT 1A receptor and potent antagonism at 5-HT 2A receptor . This receptor profile makes it possible for it to act as a dopamine system stabilizer . Based on various short term and long term studies , aripiprazole has been found to be effective in schizophrenia and has no significant adverse effect on QTc prolongation , prolactin , serum lipids , and has a low potential for weight gain . Present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole ( 10 - 15mg / day ) in the treatment of Indian patients of schizophrenia and to see its effect on QTc interval , prolactin levels , serum lipids , plasma sugar and weight gain in these patients . Outpatients with an ongoing / newly diagnosed ICD-10 Schizophrenia ( n=136 ) were randomly assigned to 10 or 15 mg dose of Aripiprazole for a period of six weeks . Clinical response was evaluated by the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale and safety was evaluated by observing spontaneously reported adverse events and changes in various laboratory parameters . Switching schizophrenic patients to aripiprazole ( 10/15 mg ) from both conventional and atypical anti - psychotics was safe and well tolerated . Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole , patients showed improvements in PANSS scores ( P < 0.001 ) , EPS , prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels . No difference was seen in the 10 or 15 mg dose groups . One hospitalization was reported ( due to hepatitis E ) . Common side effects reported were insomnia , somnolence , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea . Aripiprazole is a safe and effective anti psychotic in Indian patients - both in newly diagnosed , as well as , in patients not responding to or intolerant to other available typical and atypical antipsychotics .",scaled attention,aripiprazole (10-15mg/day) || baseline || Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS),"[(272, 291)]",3,dev,scaled attention
608,4284021_0,4284021,"TITLE : Effects of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor evacetrapib on lipoproteins , apolipoproteins and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in healthy adults ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : We investigated the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of evacetrapib . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Healthy volunteers received multiple daily doses of evacetrapib ( 10–600 mg ) administered for up to 15 days in a placebo - controlled study . ABSTRACT.KEY FINDINGS : Mean peak plasma concentrations of evacetrapib occurred at 4–6 h and terminal half - life ranged 24–44 h. Steady state was achieved at approximately 10 days ; all subjects had undetectable levels of evacetrapib 3 weeks after their last dose . The trough inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) activity was 65 and 84 % at 100 and 300 mg , respectively . At the highest dose ( 600 mg ) , evacetrapib significantly inhibited CETP activity ( 91 % ) , increased HDL - C ( 87 % ) and apo AI ( 42 % ) , and decreased LDL - C ( 29 % ) and apo B ( 26 % ) relative to placebo . For the highest dose tested , levels of evacetrapib , CETP activity , CETP mass , HDL - C and LDL - C returned to levels at or near baseline after a 2-week washout period . Evacetrapib at the highest dose tested did not produce any significant effect on 24-h ambulatory systolic or diastolic blood pressure . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Multiple doses of evacetrapib potently inhibited CETP activity , leading to substantial elevations in HDL - C and lowering of LDL - C.

524,4223523_0,4223523,"TITLE : Sleep architecture and cognitive changes in olanzapine - treated patients with depression : A double blind randomized placebo controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Disturbance in sleep quality is a symptom of Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) and Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) and thus improving quality of sleep is an important aspect of successful treatment . Here , a prospective , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study examined the effect of olanzapine ( an atypical antipsychotic ) augmentation therapy on sleep architecture , specifically slow wave sleep ( SWS ) , in the treatment of depression . The effect of olanzapine augmentation therapy on other features of sleep ( e.g. , sleep continuity ) and depression ( e.g. , illness severity and cognitive function ) were also determined . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Patients currently experiencing a major depressive episode and who were on a stable medication were included . Sleep architecture was measured by overnight ambulatory polysomnography . Illness severity was determined using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) : Spatial Working Memory ( SWM ) , Spatial Span ( SSP ) , and Reaction Time ( RTI ) tasks . Polysomnographs , clinical measures and cognitive tests were administered at baseline , after 2–4 days of treatment and after 28–31 days of treatment . Twenty - five patients participated in the study ( N = 10 , N = 15 for placebo and olanzapine treated groups respectively ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The primary objective of the study was to assess the objective ( polysomnographic ) changes in sleep quality , defined as changes in SWS , following olanzapine treatment for depression . Latency to but not duration of SWS was found to significantly differ between olanzapine- and placebo - treated participants ( Hedge 's g : 0.97 , 0.13 respectively ) . A significant improvement in olanzapine - treated participants over placebo - treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures , including sleep efficiency , total sleep time , and sleep latency . Secondary objectives assessed the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters and correlated them with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition . MADRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine - treated participants over time but not more than placebo treatment . There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo - treated participants in SWM , SSP or RTI tasks . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Olanzapine augmentation treatment generally did not improve SWS but did improve sleep continuity and depression . Olanzapine may be one of few medications that improve sleep continuity , thus directly targeting symptoms of depression .

604,3759706_5,3759706,"TITLE : Up - dosing with bilastine results in improved effectiveness in cold contact urticaria ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Cold contact urticaria ( CCU ) is characterized by itchy wheal and flare responses due to the release of histamine and other pro - inflammatory mediators after exposure to cold . The treatment of choice is nonsedating antihistamines , dosages of which may be increased up to fourfold if standard doses are ineffective . Here , we assess the effects of a standard 20 mg dose and up - dosing to 40 and 80 mg of bilastine in reducing the symptoms of CCU and inflammatory mediator release following cold challenge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty patients with CCU were included in this randomized , crossover , double - blind , placebo - controlled 12-week study . They received placebo , 20 , 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods . The primary readout was change in critical temperature thresholds ( CTT ) . Secondary readouts were changes in pruritus , levels of histamine IL-6 , IL-8 and TNF - α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective ( P < 0.0001 ) in reducing CTT . Up - dosing to 80 mg significantly ( P < 0.04 ) increased its effectiveness . At this dose , 19 of 20 ( 95 % ) patients responded to treatment , with 12 of 20 ( 60 % ) becoming symptom free . Only one patient was refractory to treatment . Microdialysis levels of histamine , IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) decreased following up - dosing with 80 mg bilastine . Bilastine treat - ment was well tolerated without evidence of increased sedation with dose escala - tion .

479,5685077_3,5685077,"TITLE : Energy Cost of Active and Sedentary Music Video Games : Drum and Handheld Gaming vs. Walking and Sitting ABSTRACT : To compare energy expenditure during and after active and handheld video game drumming compared to walking and sitting . Ten experienced , college - aged men performed four protocols ( one per week ) : no - exercise seated control ( CTRL ) , virtual drumming on a handheld gaming device ( HANDHELD ) , active drumming on drum pads ( DRUM ) , and walking on a treadmill at ~30 % of VO2max ( WALK ) . Protocols were performed after an overnight fast , and expired air was collected continuously during ( 30min ) and after ( 30min ) exercise . DRUM and HANDHELD song lists , day of the week , and time of day were identical for each participant . Significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) among the average rates of energy expenditure ( kcal·min−1 ) during activity included WALK > DRUM > HANDHELD . No significant differences in the rates of energy expenditure among groups during recovery were observed . Total energy expenditure was significantly greater ( p < 0.05 ) during WALK ( 149.5 ± 30.6 kcal ) compared to DRUM ( 118.7 ± 18.8 kcal ) and HANDHELD ( 44.9±11.6 kcal ) , and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD . Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD ( 44.9 ± 11.6 kcal ) and CTRL ( 38.2 ± 6.0 kcal ) . Active video game drumming at expert - level significantly increased energy expenditure compared to handheld , but it hardly met moderate - intensity activity standards , and energy expenditure was greatest during walking . Energy expenditure with handheld video game drumming was not different from no - exercise control . Thus , traditional aerobic exercise remains at the forefront for achieving the minimum amount and intensity of physical activity for health , individuals desiring to use video games for achieving weekly physical activity recommendations should choose games that require significant involvement of lower - body musculature , and time spent playing sedentary games should be a limited part of an active lifestyle .",scaled attention,Virtual drumming || Control || Total energy expenditure,"[(231, 255)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) . There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion / extension ( p = 0.269 ) , varus / valgus ( p = 0.653 ) or rotational alignment ( p = 0.485 ) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment ( p = 0.778 ) or posterior slope ( p = 0.164 ) of the tibial component . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS - TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed , however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss .

118,4472927_8,4472927,"TITLE : Effect of ABSTRACT : Different amounts of ingested alcohol can have distinct effects on the human body . However , there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection . We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile , oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption . A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) . Compared with group C , the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher ( P<0.001 and P<0.01 , respectively ) ; however , the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant ( P>0.05 ) . Additionally , no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups ( all P>0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B ( serum IL-10 : P<0.05 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<0.01 ) ; the serum E - selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C ( P>0.05 ) . Furthermore , the serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C ( serum IL-10 : P<0.001 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) ; however , the serum TNF - α levels did not differ among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C , there were no significant differences among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . In conclusion , we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion . Moreover , chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect , but there was no association between H. pylori infection , chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance .",ig,Alcohol consumption + H. pylori || Control || IL-10,"[(309, 325)]",0,dev,ig

Sleep architecture was measured by overnight ambulatory polysomnography . Illness severity was determined using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Cognitive function was examined using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) : Spatial Working Memory ( SWM ) , Spatial Span ( SSP ) , and Reaction Time ( RTI ) tasks . Polysomnographs , clinical measures and cognitive tests were administered at baseline , after 2–4 days of treatment and after 28–31 days of treatment . Twenty - five patients participated in the study ( N = 10 , N = 15 for placebo and olanzapine treated groups respectively ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The primary objective of the study was to assess the objective ( polysomnographic ) changes in sleep quality , defined as changes in SWS , following olanzapine treatment for depression . Latency to but not duration of SWS was found to significantly differ between olanzapine- and placebo - treated participants ( Hedge 's g : 0.97 , 0.13 respectively ) . A significant improvement in olanzapine - treated participants over placebo - treated participants was observed in secondary outcome measures , including sleep efficiency , total sleep time , and sleep latency . Secondary objectives assessed the subjective changes in sleep quality parameters and correlated them with measures of illness severity and changes in cognition . MADRS scores were significantly improved in olanzapine - treated participants over time but not more than placebo treatment . There was no significant difference between olanzapine- and placebo - treated participants in SWM , SSP or RTI tasks . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Olanzapine augmentation treatment generally did not improve SWS but did improve sleep continuity and depression . Olanzapine may be one of few medications that improve sleep continuity , thus directly targeting symptoms of depression .

The present study is aimed at assessing ginger supplement and high - intensity interval training ( HIIT ) on inflammatory indices contributing to atherosclerosis in overweight women . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The present study is a randomized , experimental , and controlled one in which thirty healthy overweight women aged 20–30 years were randomly divided into three equal groups , namely , ginger , ginger + HIIT , and placebo + HIIT . The training groups performed high - intensity interval exercises ( i.e. 40-m maximal shuttle run ) for ten consecutive weeks . The supplement groups daily took 3 g of ginger pills and the third group took placebo . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Paired t - test revealed a significant decrease in the density of type 1 monocytes chemo tactic protein ( MCP-1 ) in HIIT + ginger ( P = 0.026 ) and HIIT + placebo ( P = 0.001 ) groups . Besides , maximum aerobic capacity in the two training groups significantly increased P = 0.002 and P = 0.000 , respectively . In spite of this , analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) ( P = 0.093 ) , MCP-1(P = 0.075 ) , and serum interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) ( P = 0.164 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : A 10-week intensive interval exercise , by itself or together with ginger supplement , improved MCP-1 and maximum oxygen consumption in overweight women , without any significant effect on soluble ICAM-1 and IL-10 . These findings indicate the relative and efficient role of HIIT in overweight women without the necessity to combine with ginger as an antioxidant / anti - inflammatory supplement .",scaled attention,High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo || Ginger alone || Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),"[(229, 274)]",3,dev,scaled attention

552,4648234_1,4648234,"TITLE : A pilot test of the new Swiss regulatory procedure for categorizing clinical trials by risk : A randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND / AIMS : : Several countries are working to adapt clinical trial regulations to align the approval process to the level of risk for trial participants . The optimal framework to categorize clinical trials according to risk remains unclear , however . Switzerland is the first European country to adopt a risk - based categorization procedure in January 2014 . We assessed how accurately and consistently clinical trials are categorized using two different approaches : an approach using criteria set forth in the new law ( concept ) or an intuitive approach ( ad hoc ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : This was a randomized controlled trial with a method - comparison study nested in each arm . We used clinical trial protocols from eight Swiss ethics committees approved between 2010 and 2011 . Protocols were randomly assigned to be categorized in one of three risk categories using the concept or the ad hoc approach . Each protocol was independently categorized by the trial 's sponsor , a group of experts and the approving ethics committee . The primary outcome was the difference in categorization agreement between the expert group and sponsors across arms . Linear weighted kappa was used to quantify agreements , with the difference between kappas being the primary effect measure . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : We included 142 of 231 protocols in the final analysis ( concept = 78 ; ad hoc = 64 ) . Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm . Chance - corrected agreement was higher in the ad hoc ( kappa : 0.34 ( 95 % confidence interval = 0.10–0.58 ) ) than in the concept arm ( 0.27 ( 0.06–0.50 ) ) , but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.67 ) . ABSTRACT.LIMITATIONS : : The main limitation was the large number of protocols excluded from the analysis mostly because they did not fit with the clinical trial definition of the new law . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : A structured risk categorization approach was not better than an ad hoc approach . Laws introducing risk - based approaches should provide guidelines , examples and templates to ensure correct application .",scaled attention,New law criteria (Concept) || Intuitive approach (ad hoc) || Kappa values,"[(282, 329)]",3,dev,scaled attention

The present studies aimed to demonstrate the added benefit and optimal dosages of the combination product over individual ingredients alone in improving sleep and pain . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Each of the two studies was a two - centre , randomised , double - blind and double - dummy trial . In the first study , subjects were randomised into one of the following treatment arms : NS 440 mg / DPH 50 mg , NS 220 mg / DPH 50 mg , NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg . In the second study , subjects received either NS 440 mg / DPH 25 mg , NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg . The co - primary end - points in both studies were wake time after sleep onset ( WASO ) and sleep latency ( SL ) measured by actigraphy . Other secondary sleep and pain end - points were also assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The intent - to - treat population included 712 and 267 subjects from studies one and two , respectively . In the first study , only the NS 440 mg / DPH 50 mg combination showed significant improvements in both WASO vs. NS alone ( −70.3 min p = 0.0002 ) and SL vs. DPH alone ( 25.50 and 41.50 min respectively , p < 0.0001 ) . In the second study , the NS 440 mg / DPH 25 mg combination failed to show any significant improvements vs. either component alone .

Deliberate restriction of food intake ( dieting ) produces short - term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long - term weight management . Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating ( ie , eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals ) and the development of greater psychological flexibility ( ie , the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ ACT ] ) . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : This pilot study investigated the usage , acceptability , and feasibility of "" Mind , Body , Food , "" a Web - based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants were 40 overweight women ( mean age 44.8 [ standard deviation , SD , 3.06 ] years , mean body mass index [ BMI ] 32.9 [ SD 6.01 ] kg / m2 , mean Intuitive Eating Scale [ IES-1 ] total score 53.4 [ SD 7.46 ] , classified as below average ) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin , New Zealand . Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics . Use of an online self - monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database . Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention . BMI , intuitive eating , binge eating , psychological flexibility , and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 40 women enrolled in the study , 12 ( 30 % ) completed all 12 modules ( median 7.5 [ interquartile range , IQR , 2 - 12 ] modules ) and 4 ( 10 % ) used the self - monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period ( median 3 [ IQR 1 - 9 ] weeks ) . Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments , most women rated "" Mind , Body , Food "" as useful ( 20/26 , 77 % ) , easy to use ( 17/25 , 68 % ) and liked the intervention ( 22/25 , 88 % ) . From pre- to postintervention , there were statistically significant within - group increases in intuitive eating ( IES-2 total score P<.001 ; all IES-2 subscale scores : P ≤.01 ) , psychological flexibility ( P=.01 ) , and general mental health ( P<.001 ) as well as significant decreases in binge eating ( P=.01 ) . At the 3-month follow - up , IES-2 improvements were maintained , and there were further improvements in binge eating ( P<.001 ) and general mental health ( P=.03 ) , and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility ( P=.06 ) . There were no significant within - group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow - up ( P=.46 and P=.93 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The "" Mind , Body , Food "" prototype Web - based intervention is appealing to middle - aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills , reduce binge eating , and maintain weight over 3 months . Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial .",scaled attention,Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy || Control || General mental health,"[(399, 454)]",3,dev,scaled attention
651,4684352_5,4684352,"TITLE : Dietary Mannoheptulose Does Not Significantly Alter Daily Energy Expenditure in Adult Labrador Retrievers ABSTRACT : Mannoheptulose ( MH ) , a sugar found in avocados that inhibits glycolysis in vitro , has been preliminarily investigated as a novel food ingredient for dogs . This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH , delivered as an extract of un - ripened avocado , on energy expenditure ( EE ) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs ( total of 12 dogs , 26.99 ± 0.634 kg , 4.9 ± 0.2 y ) . The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",scaled attention,Mannoheptulose || Control || Ratio of fat to lean body mass,"[(258, 287)]",3,dev,scaled attention

A report from the Dutch Neuro - Oncology Group BELOB trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Angiogenesis is crucial for glioblastoma growth , and anti - vascular endothelial growth factor agents are widely used in recurrent glioblastoma patients . The number of circulating endothelial cells ( CECs ) is a surrogate marker for endothelial damage . We assessed their kinetics and explored their prognostic value in patients with recurrent glioblastoma . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : In this side study of the BELOB trial , 141 patients with recurrent glioblastoma were randomised to receive single - agent bevacizumab or lomustine , or bevacizumab plus lomustine . Before treatment , after 4 weeks and after 6 weeks of treatment , CECs were enumerated . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The number of CECs increased during treatment with bevacizumab plus lomustine , but not during treatment in the single - agent arms . In patients treated with lomustine single agent , higher absolute CEC numbers after 4 weeks ( log10CEC hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.41 , 95 % CI 0.18–0.91 ) and 6 weeks ( log10CEC HR 0.16 , 95 % CI 0.05–0.56 ) of treatment were associated with improved overall survival ( OS ) .

Methods . A randomized , double - blind , double - dummy , active - controlled , two - period crossover study in adult patients receiving around - the - clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge . Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient . The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 ( moderate withdrawal ) or use of rescue medication . Results . 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal . One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50 % full μ - opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity . The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar , and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine . There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments . The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache ( 19 % ) , vomiting ( 13 % ) , nausea , diarrhea , and drug withdrawal syndrome ( each 9 % ) , and with full μ - opioid agonist were headache ( 16 % ) , drug withdrawal syndrome ( 13 % ) , and nausea ( 6 % ) . Conclusions . Chronic pain patients treated with around - the - clock full μ - opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine ( a partial μ - opioid agonist ) at approximately 50 % of the full μ - opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control .",scaled attention,Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP) || Full μ-opioid agonist* || pain ratings,"[(220, 231)]",3,dev,scaled attention
136,4526979_2,4526979,"TITLE : The Web - Based Osteoarthritis Management Resource My Joint Pain Improves Quality of Care : A Quasi - Experimental Study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Despite the availability of evidence - based guidelines for conservative treatment of osteoarthritis ( OA ) , management is often confined to the use of analgesics and waiting for eventual total joint replacement . This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web - based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored , evidence - based information and tools aimed to improve self - management of OA on self - management and change in knowledge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A quasi - experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period . The intervention provided participants with general and user - specific information , monthly assessments with validated instruments , and progress - tracking tools . A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self - assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires ( users : n=104 ; nonusers : n=91 ) . The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire ( heiQ ) to evaluate 8 different domains ( health - directed activity , positive and active engagement in life , emotional distress , self - monitoring and insight , constructive attitudes and approaches , skill and technique acquisition , social integration and support , health service navigation ) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator ( OAQI ) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants . Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi - square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender ( 152/195 , 77.9 % female ) , age ( mean 60 , SD 9 years ) and body mass index ( mean 31.1 , SD 6.8 kg / m2 ) . With the exception of health service navigation , mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers , although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance . Within - group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self - management ( absolute change score=15 % , P=.03 ) , lifestyle ( absolute change score=16 % , P=.02 ) , and physical activity ( absolute change score=11 % , P=.04 ) , with no significant improvements for the nonusers . Following 12 months of exposure to the website , there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self - management ( absolute change score 15 % vs 2 % , P=.001 ) and weight reduction ( absolute change scores 3 % vs – 6 % , P=.03 ) measured on the OAQI . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ , but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA .

The supplement groups daily took 3 g of ginger pills and the third group took placebo . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Paired t - test revealed a significant decrease in the density of type 1 monocytes chemo tactic protein ( MCP-1 ) in HIIT + ginger ( P = 0.026 ) and HIIT + placebo ( P = 0.001 ) groups . Besides , maximum aerobic capacity in the two training groups significantly increased P = 0.002 and P = 0.000 , respectively . In spite of this , analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) ( P = 0.093 ) , MCP-1(P = 0.075 ) , and serum interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) ( P = 0.164 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : A 10-week intensive interval exercise , by itself or together with ginger supplement , improved MCP-1 and maximum oxygen consumption in overweight women , without any significant effect on soluble ICAM-1 and IL-10 . These findings indicate the relative and efficient role of HIIT in overweight women without the necessity to combine with ginger as an antioxidant / anti - inflammatory supplement .",scaled attention,High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo || Ginger alone || Serum interleukin-10 (IL-10),"[(229, 274)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Completion rate was 71 % ( n = 71 ) in the intensive lifestyle intervention ( ILI ) group and 85 % ( n = 33 ) among waiting list controls . Compared to controls body weight ( −17.0 ( 95 % CI : −18.7 , −15.3 ) kg , P < 0.0001 ) , fat mass ( −15.2 ( 95 % CI : −17.4 , −13.1 ) kg , P < 0.0001 ) , fat free mass ( −1.2 ( 95 % CI : −2.2 , −0.2 ) kg , P = 0.016 ) and visceral fat ( −86.6(95 % CI : −97.4 , −75.7 ) cm2 , P < 0.0001 ) were reduced in the ILI - group after 10–14 weeks . Within the ILI - group weight loss was −23.8 ( 95 % CI : −25.9 , −21.7 ) kg , P < 0.0001 and -20.3 ( 95 % CI : −23.3 , −17.3 ) kg , P < 0.0001 , after six and 12 months , respectively . Systolic BP , glucose , triglycerides , and LDL - C were reduced , and HDL - C was increased ( all P ≤ 0.006 ) after 10–14 weeks within the ILI group . The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL - C were sustained after 12 months ( all P < 0.0001 ) . After one year , weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating ( all P < 0.05 ) . Thus , ILI including high volume of PA resulted in weight loss with almost maintenance of fat - free mass , favorable changes in CVD risk factors , and eating behavior in subjects with severe obesity .",gradients,Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group || Waiting list control || Visceral fat,"[(122, 214)]",4,dev,gradients

Telemonitoring has been proposed as a solution to this growing problem , but its impact on patient outcome is equivocal . This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate effectiveness of telemonitoring in improving COPD patient outcome . In total , 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring ( n = 53 ) or usual care ( n = 53 ) group . During the two months following discharge , telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary . The primary outcome measure was time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge . During the follow - up period , time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group ( p = 0.026 ) . Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all - cause re - admissions ( 0.23 vs. 0.68 / patient ; p = 0.002 ) and emergency room visits ( 0.36 vs. 0.91 / patient ; p = 0.006 ) . In conclusion , telemonitoring intervention was associated with improved outcomes among COPD patients admitted for exacerbation in a country characterized by a small territory and high accessibility to medical services . The findings are encouraging and add further support to implementation of telemonitoring as part of COPD care .",attention,telemonitoring group || usual group || the number of all-cause re-admissions over a period of six months,"[(184, 225)]",1,dev,attention
186,2966708_4,2966708,"TITLE : Comparison of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses after laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Laparoscopic surgery is associated with a more favorable clinical outcome than that of conventional open surgery . This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The laparoscopic surgical procedure leaves the endocrine metabolic response largely unaltered as compared with that of open abdominal hysterectomy , but it reduces the inflammatory response as measured by the IL-6 and CRP levels .",ig,Laparoscopic hysterectomy || Abdominal hysterectom || IL-6 levels,"[(187, 220)]",0,dev,ig
160,3687261_1,3687261,"TITLE : Effects of a ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Macronutrient "" preloads "" can reduce postprandial glycemia by slowing gastric emptying and stimulating glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion . An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In type 2 diabetes , acute administration of a d - xylose preload reduces postprandial glycemia and enhances the effect of a DPP-4 inhibitor .",attention,sitagliptin and d-xylose || placebo and sucralose || peak blood glucose,"[(177, 231)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.DESIGN : Quasi - randomized controlled trial . ABSTRACT.SETTING : A total of 34 randomly selected general practices from a German region ( participation rate 87 % ) . ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS : A total of 1499 consecutive patients aged 18–70 years with daily cigarette smoking ( participation rate 80 % ) . ABSTRACT.INTERVENTIONS : The tailored letters intervention group received up to three individualized personal letters . Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session . Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change . ABSTRACT.MEASUREMENTS : Self - reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6- , 12- , 18- and 24-month follow - ups . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : Among participants completing the last follow - up , 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3 % in the tailored letters intervention group , 14.8 % in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5 % in the assessment - only control group . Assuming those lost to follow - up to be smokers , the rates were 10.2 % , 9.7 % and 6.7 % , respectively . Analyses including all follow - ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only . Using complete case analysis , the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.4 ; P = 0.047 ] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence ( OR = 1.4 ; P = 0.068 ) for prolonged abstinence , or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow - up . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The study demonstrated long - term efficacy of low - cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice . The interventions are suitable to reach entire populations of general practices and smoking patients . Computer - generated letters are a promising option to overcome barriers to provide smoking cessation counselling routinely .",gradients,Tailored letters || Practitioner-delivered brief advice || 7-day point prevalence abstinence,"[(281, 339)]",4,dev,gradients

Because a low - fat plant - based diet has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes , we hypothesized that such a diet would reduce painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : In this 20-week pilot study , individuals with type 2 diabetes and painful diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to two groups . The intervention group was asked to follow a low - fat , plant - based diet , with weekly classes for support in following the prescribed diet , and to take a vitamin B12 supplement . The control group was asked to take the same vitamin B12 supplement , but received no other intervention . At baseline , midpoint and 20 weeks , clinical , laboratory and questionnaire data were collected . Questionnaires included an analog ' worst pain ' scale , Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument , global impression scale , Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire , Neuropathy Total Symptom Score , a weekly pain diary and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : After 20 weeks , body weight change with the intervention was −6.4 kg ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) −9.4 to −3.4 , P<0.001 ) in an effect size analysis . Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot improved by an average of 12.4 microseimens ( 95 % CI 1.2–23.6 , P=0.03 ) with the intervention in an effect size analysis . The between - group difference in change in pain , as measured by the McGill pain questionnaire , was −8.2 points ( 95 % CI −16.1 to −0.3 , P=0.04 ) . Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire score change was −1.6 points ( 95 % CI −3.0 to −0.2 , P=0.03 ) .

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : 191 chemotherapy - naïve patients were randomized to receive TOMOX or FOLFOX4 . Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Overall response rate was the primary endpoint . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 183 patients were included in the intent - to - treat analysis ( 92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4 ) . Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % ( p = 0.003 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival ( 15.6 and 17.2 months ; p = 0.475 ) ; progression - free survival ( 7.7 and 8.7 months ; p = 0.292 ) , and response duration ( 6.4 and 7.6 months ; p = 0.372 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia ( p < 0.0001 ) and leukopenia ( p = 0.028 ) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen , while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group ( p = ns ) . There were two treatment - related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm . Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks , and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks ; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first - line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : In an open - label randomized trial , HIV - infected patients were randomized to switch from zidovudine / lamivudine ( AZT/3TC ) to abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) or tenofovir / emtricitabine ( TDF / FTC ) . We measured bone mass density ( BMD ) and bone turnover biomarkers ( osteocalcin , osteocalcin , procollagen type 1 N - terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) , alkaline phosphatase , type I collagen cross - linked C - telopeptide ( CTx ) , and osteoprotegerin ) . We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance , plasma cystatin C , and urinary levels of creatinine , albumin , cystatin C , and neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of 40 included patients , 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up . BMD was measured in 33 , 26 , and 27 patients at baseline , week 24 , and week 48 , respectively . In TDF / FTC - treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 ( −1.8 % and −2.5 % ) and week 48 ( −2.1 % and −2.1 % ) , whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm . The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms . All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF / FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm , but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD . Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF - treated patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Switching to TDF / FTC - based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC - based treatment . No major difference in renal function was observed .

Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation ( DRCFI ) contains liposomal ciprofloxacin , formulated to optimise airway antibiotic delivery . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Phase II , 24-week Australian / New Zealand multicentre , randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in 42 adult bronchiectasis subjects with ≥2 pulmonary exacerbations in the prior 12 months and ciprofloxacin - sensitive P aeruginosa at screening . Subjects received DRCFI or placebo in three treatment cycles of 28 days on/28 days off . The primary outcome was change in sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density to the end of treatment cycle 1 ( day 28 ) , analysed by modified intention to treat ( mITT ) . Key secondary outcomes included safety and time to first pulmonary exacerbation — after reaching the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint subjects discontinued study drug although remained in the study . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : DRCFI resulted in a mean ( SD ) 4.2 ( 3.7 ) log10 CFU / g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 ( vs −0.08 ( 3.8 ) with placebo , p=0.002 ) . DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation ( median 134 vs 58 days , p=0.057 mITT , p=0.046 per protocol ) . DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group , but fewer pulmonary adverse events . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Once - daily inhaled DRCFI demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non - CF bronchiectasis and ciprofloxacin - sensitive P aeruginosa . In this modest - sized phase II study , DRCFI was also well tolerated and delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation in the per protocol population .",attention,Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI) || Placebo || CFU/g reduction in bacterial density of Pseudomona aeruginosa,"[(209, 244)]",1,dev,attention

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) .

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity . We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time .

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms , and levels of proinflammatory cytokines , brain - derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers , would predict or impact treatment response . ABSTRACT.METHOD : : Seventy - nine participants ( 10 dropouts ) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self - report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation ( containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum ) or a matched placebo , in a double - blind trial for 8 weeks . Data were analysed as intent - to - treat . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure ( Cohen 's d range = 0.07–0.16 ) or any blood - based biomarker . At end - point , 9 ( 23 % ) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60 % change on the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( responders ) , compared to 10 ( 26 % ) of those in the placebo group ( χ12=0.107 , p = ns ) . Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures . Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood , or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers . The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity , chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample ; recruiting an antidepressant - naive sample experiencing mild , acute symptoms of low mood , may well yield a different result . Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective . Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area . The results of this trial are preliminary ; future studies in the area should not be discouraged .",scaled attention,Probiotics || Placebo || Depression,"[(176, 230)]",3,dev,scaled attention

24,5312688_2,5312688,"TITLE : Acceptability and efficacy of interactive short message service intervention in improving HIV medication adherence in Chinese antiretroviral treatment - naïve individuals ABSTRACT.AIM : The aim of this study was to examine the acceptability and efficacy of interactive short message service ( SMS ) in improving medication adherence in antiretroviral treatment ( ART)-naïve individuals living with HIV / AIDS in Hengyang , Hunan , China . ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : SMS via mobile phone has emerged as a potential tool for improving ART adherence . However , most studies used SMS only as a medication reminder , with few studies exploring the effect of comprehensive , interactive SMS . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : In a randomized controlled trial , 100 HIV - positive patients on ART for <3 months were randomized into control or intervention arm . Participants in the control group received routine standard instruction for ART medication in the HIV clinics , while the intervention group received 6 months of an SMS intervention in addition to the standard care . A total of 124 text messages within 6 modules were edited , preinstalled , and sent to participants according to personalized schedules . Knowledge ( of HIV and HIV medications ) , self - reported antiretroviral adherence ( Visual Analog Scale [ VAS ] and Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS [ CPCRA ] Antiretroviral Medication Self - Report ) , and CD4 count were assessed at baseline and immediate post - intervention . Intervention participants were interviewed after completion of the study about their satisfaction with and acceptability of the SMS intervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline assessments were comparable between arms . Repeated - measures analysis showed that both HIV - related and ART medication knowledge of the intervention group showed better improvement over time than those of the control group after the intervention ( P<0.0001 ) . For the adherence measures , compared with the control group , participants in the intervention group had significantly higher VAS mean score ( Z=2.735 , P=0.006 ) and lower suboptimal adherence rate ( Z=2.208 , P=0.027 ) at the end of the study . The intervention had no effect on CD4 cell count . Almost all ( 96 % ) intervention participants reported satisfaction or high satisfaction with the SMS intervention , with 74 % desiring to continue to receive the SMS intervention . The preferred frequency of messages was 1–2 messages per week . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : An interactive SMS intervention with comprehensive content shows promising efficacy in promoting medication adherence in ART - naïve individuals . Future work might further refine its ability to optimally tailor the intervention for individual preferences .",attention,interactive short message service (SMS) || standard care || VAS mean score,"[(311, 355)]",1,dev,attention

Completion rate was 71 % ( n = 71 ) in the intensive lifestyle intervention ( ILI ) group and 85 % ( n = 33 ) among waiting list controls . Compared to controls body weight ( −17.0 ( 95 % CI : −18.7 , −15.3 ) kg , P < 0.0001 ) , fat mass ( −15.2 ( 95 % CI : −17.4 , −13.1 ) kg , P < 0.0001 ) , fat free mass ( −1.2 ( 95 % CI : −2.2 , −0.2 ) kg , P = 0.016 ) and visceral fat ( −86.6(95 % CI : −97.4 , −75.7 ) cm2 , P < 0.0001 ) were reduced in the ILI - group after 10–14 weeks . Within the ILI - group weight loss was −23.8 ( 95 % CI : −25.9 , −21.7 ) kg , P < 0.0001 and -20.3 ( 95 % CI : −23.3 , −17.3 ) kg , P < 0.0001 , after six and 12 months , respectively . Systolic BP , glucose , triglycerides , and LDL - C were reduced , and HDL - C was increased ( all P ≤ 0.006 ) after 10–14 weeks within the ILI group . The reduction in glucose and increase in HDL - C were sustained after 12 months ( all P < 0.0001 ) . After one year , weight loss was related to increased cognitive restraint and decreased uncontrolled eating ( all P < 0.05 ) . Thus , ILI including high volume of PA resulted in weight loss with almost maintenance of fat - free mass , favorable changes in CVD risk factors , and eating behavior in subjects with severe obesity .",ig,Intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) group || Waiting list control || Visceral fat,"[(122, 214)]",0,dev,ig

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different pre - treatments ( ethanol , ethylene de amine tetra acetic acid [ EDTA ] and EDTA + ethanol ) on the bond strength of adhesively lutted tooth colored fiber post . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : Forty - eight human anterior teeth ( incisor and canine ) were selected in this experimental study . The species were endodontically treated , and the post - space was prepared . The species were randomly divided into four groups of 12 teeth in each and were treated as follows : ( i ) 0.1 M EDTA , ( ii ) 99.6 % ethanol , ( iii ) 0.1 M EDTA followed by 99.6 % ethanol and ( iv ) without any treatment ( control ) . A push - out test was carried out after 24 h. Each tooth was cut into three 1 mm - thick sections . Fracture type was assessed using stereomicroscope . The data were analyzed by one way - ANOVA followed by Scheffe post - hoc test at P = 0.05 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Almost , in EDTA and ( EDTA + ethanol ) every sample failed at the interface between post and lutting cement .

609,5029174_0,5029174,"TITLE : Job Maintenance through Supported Employment PLUS : A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : Sickness absence from work due to experienced distress and mental health issues has continuously increased over the past years in Germany . To investigate how this alarming development can be counteracted , we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a job coaching intervention to maintain the working capacity of members of staff and ultimately prevent sickness absence . Our sample included N = 99 employees who reported mental distress due to work - related problems . The intervention group ( n = 58 ) received between 8 and 12 individual job coaching sessions in which they worked with a professional job coach to reduce their mental distress . The control group ( n = 41 ) received a brochure about mental distress . Data were collected before the start of the study , at the end of the job coaching intervention , and at a 3-month follow - up . These data included the number of sickness absence days as the primary outcome and questionnaire measures to assess burnout indicators , life satisfaction , and work - related experiences and behaviors . Compared with the control group , the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group but fewer depressive symptoms , a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work , more experience of work - related success , less depletion of emotional resources , and a greater satisfaction with life when participants had received the job coaching . Thus , although we could not detect a reduction in sickness absence between the groups , job coaching was shown to be a viable intervention technique to benefit employees by contributing to re - establish their mental health . We discuss the implications of the study and outline future research .",ig,Job coaching sessions || Control || Sickness absence,"[(197, 215)]",0,dev,ig

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity . We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time . ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial .

We investigated the possible effects of Bifidobacterium animalisssp . lactis 420 ( B420 ) and the dietary fiber Litesse ® Ultra polydextrose ( LU ) on body fat mass and other obesity - related parameters . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 225 healthy volunteers ( healthy , BMI 28–34.9 ) were randomized into four groups ( 1:1:1:1 ) , using a computer - generated sequence , for 6 months of double - blind , parallel treatment : 1 ) Placebo , microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 2 ) LU , 12 g / d ; 3 ) B420 , 1010 CFU / d in microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 4 ) LU + B420 , 12 g + 1010 CFU / d . Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",scaled attention,Litesse® Ultra polydextrose || Placebo || Body fat mass,"[(352, 434)]",3,dev,scaled attention

A Randomised - Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : The efficacy of an enhanced version of the Aussie Optimism Program ( AOP ) was investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial . Grade 6 students aged 10–11 years of age ( N = 2288 ) from 63 government primary schools in Perth , Western Australia , participated in the pre , post , and follow - up study . Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions : Aussie Optimism with teacher training , Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching , or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum . Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20 , 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school . Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year , plus a self - directed program in Grade 7 . Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire . Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV , to assess suicidal ideation and behavior , and depressive and anxiety disorders . Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes : a significant increase in student - reported pro - social behavior from pre - test to post - test 1 ( maintained at post - test 2 ) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post - test 2 and follow - up . No significant intervention effects on anxiety and depressive disorders , and total difficulties were reported .

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity . We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time . ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial .

384,3376522_0,3376522,"TITLE : The Influence of User Characteristics and a Periodic Email Prompt on Exposure to an Internet - Delivered Computer - Tailored Lifestyle Program ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The Internet is a promising medium in the field of health promotion for offering tailored and targeted lifestyle interventions applying computer - tailored ( CT ) techniques to the general public . Actual exposure to CT interventions is not living up to its high expectations , as only a ( limited ) proportion of the target group is actually using these programs . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To investigate exposure to an Internet - delivered , CT lifestyle intervention , targeting physical activity , fruit and vegetable intake , smoking behavior , and alcohol intake , we focused on three processes : first use , prolonged use , and sustained use . The first objectives were to identify user characteristics that predict initiation of an online CT lifestyle program ( first use ) and completion of this program ( prolonged use ) . Furthermore , we studied the effect of using a proactive strategy , consisting of periodic email prompts , on program revisits ( sustained use ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The research population for this study consisted of Dutch adults participating in the Adult Health Monitor , offered by the regional public health services . We used a randomized controlled trial design to assess predictors of first use , prolonged use , and sustained use . Demographics and behavioral characteristics , as well as the strategy used for revisiting , were included as predictors in the model . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program . Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the CT modules were male , older , and employed , and had a lower income , higher body mass index , and relatively unhealthy lifestyle . Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the CT modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle . Finally , using a proactive strategy influenced sustained use , with people from the prompting condition being more likely to revisit the program ( odds ratio 28.92 , 95 % confidence interval 10.65–78.52 ; P < .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Older , male , and employed participants , and those with a lower income , higher body mass index , and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a CT module . Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age . The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions . However , these people tended to disengage from the program . This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use . Furthermore , sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program . Though promising , this effect was modest and needs to be further examined , in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting .

A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy ; however , a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : Eighty – six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012 . The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively , while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The groups were equal with respect to age , gender , indication , surgeon , and type of diversion . Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay ( LOS ) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan ( 10.5 vs. 8.6 days , p = 0.005 , 95 % CI 0.6–3.3 ) . Readmission for ileus was low in both alvimopan and control groups ( 0 % and 4.4 % , respectively ) . Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups ( 2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p < 0.001 ) . This difference stood up to multivariate analysis with a $ 7,062 difference in hospital stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Use of alvimopan in the routine perioperative care of our cystectomy and urinary diversion patients has decreased LOS by 1.9 days .

509,3877985_0,3877985,"TITLE : Plasma oxytocin changes and anti - obsessive response during serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment : a placebo controlled study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The drug treatments of choice for obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SRIs ) . However , a correlation between the neuropeptide oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid and the severity of OCD has previously been shown , and oxytocin and serotonin are interconnected within the brain . Few studies have investigated whether SRIs have any effect on oxytocin ; thus , our aim was to explore the possibility that oxytocinergic mechanisms contribute to the anti - obsessive effect of SRIs . ABSTRACT.METHOD : In a randomized , double - blind trial , comparing SRIs ( clomipramine and paroxetine ) with placebo in 36 adults with OCD ( characterized for subtypes ) , plasma oxytocin was measured with radioimmunoassay after plasma extraction , at baseline , after 1 week , and after 4 weeks of treatment , and related to baseline severity and clinical response after 12 weeks , as measured by the Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y - BOCS ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline oxytocin levels correlated positively with baseline Y - BOCS ratings , but only among the future SRI responders . Patients with early onset of OCD had higher baseline oxytocin . During treatment , plasma oxytocin did not differ between SRI and placebo treatment . In SRI responders , plasma oxytocin first decreased and then increased ; in non - responders ( to SRI as well as to placebo ) , the reverse was the case . After 4 weeks , treatment responders had attained higher oxytocin levels compared to non - responders . The intra - individual range ( i.e. the variability ) of plasma oxytocin between measurements was the measure that best differentiated responders from non - responders . This range was higher in responders than non - responders , and lower in patients with autistic traits . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : SRIs have highly variable effects on plasma oxytocin between individuals . The associations between baseline oxytocin and OCD severity and between oxytocin changes and treatment response support the notions that oxytocin is involved in OCD pathophysiology , and that the anti - obsessive effects of SRIs are partly exerted through oxytocinergic mechanisms .",scaled attention,SRIs (clomipramine and paroxetine) || placebo || oxytocin levels,"[(224, 238)]",3,dev,scaled attention
249,3564932_10,3564932,"TITLE : Outpatient Foley catheter versus inpatient prostaglandin E2 gel for induction of labour : a randomised trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Induction of labour ( IOL ) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions , with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery . Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) .

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Guided CQI program implementation increased the self - reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff .

67,2744923_1,2744923,"TITLE : Measurement of adherence , drug concentrations and the effectiveness of artemether - lumefantrine , chlorproguanil - dapsone or sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Malawi ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine ( SP ) is the only single dose therapy for uncomplicated malaria , but there is widespread resistance . At the time of this study , artemether - lumefantrine ( AL ) and chlorproguanil - dapsone ( CPD ) , both multi - dose regimes , were considered possible alternatives to SP in Malawi . The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of AL and CPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Children ≥12 months and adults with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive AL , CPD or SP . Adherence was measured using a questionnaire and electronic monitoring devices , MEMSTM , pill bottles that recorded the date and time of opening . Day-7 plasma dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations were measured to examine their relationship with adherence and clinical response . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 841 patients were recruited . The day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response ( ACPR ) rates , using intention to treat analysis ( missing data treated as failure ) , were AL 85.2 % , CPD 63.7 % and SP 50 % . ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 ( p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons ) . CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 ( p = 0.01 ) , but not day-42 . Very high adherence was reported using the questionnaire , 100 % for AL treated patients and 99.2 % for the CPD group . Only three CPD participants admitted missing any doses . 164/181 ( 90.6 % ) of CPD treated patients took all their doses out of the MEMSTM container and they were more likely to have a day-28 ACPR than those who did not take all their medication out of the container , p = 0.024 . Only 7/87 ( 8 % ) AL treated patients did not take all of their doses out of their MEMSTM container and none had treatment failure . Median day-7 dapsone concentrations were higher in CPD treated patients with ACPR than in treatment failures , p = 0.012 . There were no differences in day-7 dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations between those who took all their doses from the MEMSTM container and those who did not . A day-7 lumefantrine concentration reported to be predictive of AL treatment failure in Thailand was not useful in this population ; only one of 16 participants with a concentration below this threshold ( 175 ng / ml ) had treatment failure . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : This study provides reassurance of the effectiveness of AL , even with unsupervised dosing , as it is rolled out across sub - Saharan Africa . Self - reported adherence appears to be an unreliable measure of adherence in this population .",scaled attention,Chlorproguanil-dapsone (CPD) || Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) || Effectiveness at day 42,"[(243, 261)]",3,dev,scaled attention

209,4048141_1,4048141,"TITLE : Clinical Relevance of Vilazodone Treatment in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder : Categorical Improvement in Symptoms ABSTRACT : Objective : To assess clinically relevant symptom improvement in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) receiving vilazodone by using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , a clinician - rated scale used to measure MDD symptom severity and improvement . Method : Pooled data from 2 positive , phase 3 , 8-week , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trials in patients with MDD were analyzed . Patients received vilazodone 40 mg / d or placebo ; post hoc analyses were conducted on study completers . Depression symptom improvement was evaluated by analyzing the proportions of patients who shifted from the baseline MADRS single - item symptom severity category of ≥ 2 ( mild to severe symptoms ) to an end - of - study category < 2 ( minimal to no symptoms ) or from ≥ 4 ( moderate to severe symptoms ) to ≤ 2 ( mild to no symptoms ) . The proportion of patients who shifted from anxious depression to no anxious depression was also analyzed . Results : The percentage of patients who completed these studies with severity category shift from baseline ≥ 2 to end of study < 2 was significantly higher for vilazodone versus placebo on all MADRS items ( odds ratio [ OR ] range , 1.4–1.7 , P < .05 ) except reduced appetite ( OR = 1.3 , P = .232 ) . A significantly greater proportion of vilazodone - treated versus placebo - treated patients shifted from baseline ≥ 4 to end of study ≤ 2 on MADRS items of apparent sadness , reported sadness , inner tension , reduced sleep , and lassitude ( OR range , 1.5–2.0 , P < .05 ) . Additionally , a significantly greater proportion of vilazodone - treated versus placebo - treated patients shifted from anxious depression at baseline to no anxious depression at end of study ( OR = 1.5 , P = .031 ) . Conclusions : These results suggest that vilazodone treatment is associated with clinically relevant changes in depression symptoms in patients with MDD .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : : We undertook a double - blind , placebo - controlled phase III trial of 269 patients previously treated for metastatic colorectal cancer and enrolled in 5 centres in South Korea . Patients were randomly assigned ( 1 : 1 ) to one of the following groups : FOLFIRI / XELIRI plus simvastatin ( 40 mg ) or FOLFIRI / XELIRI plus placebo . The FOLFIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan at 180 mg m−2 as a 90-min infusion , leucovorin at 200 mg m−2 as a 2-h infusion , and a bolus injection of 5-FU 400 mg m−2 followed by a 46-h continuous infusion of 5-FU at 2400 mg m−2 . The XELIRI regimen consisted of irinotecan at 250 mg m−2 as a 90-min infusion with capecitabine 1000 mg m−2 twice daily for 14 days . The primary end point was progression - free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary end points included response rate , duration of response , overall survival ( OS ) , time to progression , and toxicity . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Between April 2010 and July 2013 , 269 patients were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups ( 134 simvastatin , 135 placebo ) . The median PFS was 5.9 months ( 95 % CI , 4.5–7.3 ) in the XELIRI / FOLFIRI plus simvastatin group and 7.0 months ( 95 % CI , 5.4–8.6 ) in the XELIRI / FOLFIRI plus placebo group ( P=0.937 ) . No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to OS ( median , 15.9 months ( simvastatin ) vs 19.9 months ( placebo ) , P=0.826 ) .

485,2717426_0,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Acute , exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill . These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill .

114,4472927_4,4472927,"TITLE : Effect of ABSTRACT : Different amounts of ingested alcohol can have distinct effects on the human body . However , there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection . We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile , oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption . A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) . Compared with group C , the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher ( P<0.001 and P<0.01 , respectively ) ; however , the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant ( P>0.05 ) . Additionally , no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups ( all P>0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B ( serum IL-10 : P<0.05 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<0.01 ) ; the serum E - selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C ( P>0.05 ) . Furthermore , the serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C ( serum IL-10 : P<0.001 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) ; however , the serum TNF - α levels did not differ among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C , there were no significant differences among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . In conclusion , we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion . Moreover , chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect , but there was no association between H. pylori infection , chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance .",attention,Alcohol consumption + H. pylori || Control || E-selectin,"[(309, 350)]",1,dev,attention

This study examined whether the adverse effects of ketamine on oculomotor performance can be reversed by the atypical antipsychotic risperidone . In this randomized double - blind , placebo - controlled study , 72 healthy participants performed smooth pursuit eye movements ( SPEM ) , prosaccades ( PS ) and antisaccades ( AS ) while being randomly assigned to one of four drug groups ( intravenous 100 ng ml−1 ketamine , 2 mg oral risperidone , 100 ng ml−1 ketamine plus 2 mg oral risperidone , placebo ) . Drug administration did not lead to harmful adverse events . Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM ( all P<0.01 ) but had no significant effects on PS or AS ( all P⩾0.07 ) . An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS , indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo ( both P⩽0.04 ) . No ketamine by risperidone interactions were found ( all P⩾0.26 ) . The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia . The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine - induced deteriorations . These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance - enhancing compounds to optimise pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia .",scaled attention,Ketamine || Placebo || Smooth pursuit saccadic frequency,"[(146, 174)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index ( GI ) and anti - hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats . Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) . No significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) in insulin , cholesterol measurements ( total cholesterol , LDL - C , HDL - C , triglycerides and cholesterol ratios ) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed . All other measurements ( AST , ALT , ALP , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c ( p > 0.05 ) of type 2 diabetic patients . The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested . Therefore , the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients .",attention,Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) || Any other food || Liver enzymes,"[(459, 486)]",1,dev,attention
401,3544341_0,3544341,"TITLE : Preliminary study of highly cross - linked hyaluronic acid - based combination therapy for management of knee osteoarthritis - related pain ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Hyaluronic acid has been extensively used for treatment of knee osteoarthritis due to its anti - inflammatory properties and its ability to act as a synovial lubricant . Furthermore , it has found application in combination with other drugs in the dermatological field and in pre - clinical studies in animal models of osteoarthritis . Experimental evidence suggests that a combination of this macromolecule with other drugs may act as a slow - release depot . However , to date , to the best of our knowledge , no one has tested local intra - articular delivery of highly cross - linked hyaluronic acid combined with bisphosphonate or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs for management of knee osteoarthritis pain in the clinical setting . The aim of the present randomized double - blind study was to investigate , for the first time , the effect of a highly cross - linked hyaluronic acid , Variofill ® , alone or in combination with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate , for management of bilateral knee osteoarthritis - related pain . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Sixty - two patients with symptomatic bilateral medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis ( Kellgren – Lawrence grade II and III ) and pain in both knees corresponding to a daily visual analog scale ( VAS ) score ≥ 30 in the month before the beginning of the study were included in this investigation . Patients were divided into three groups : group 1 , treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid alone ( 66 mg ) into each knee ; group 2 , treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid ( 49.5 mg ) plus diclofenac sodium ( 5 mg ) into each knee ; group 3 , treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid ( 49.5 mg ) plus sodium clodronate ( 5 mg ) into each knee . Patients also underwent blood tests for measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) and C - reactive protein ( CRP ) immediately before and at 6-month follow - up . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Hyaluronic acid alone and in combination with sodium clodronate or diclofenac sodium produced a significant improvement in mean VAS pain score at 3 and 6-month follow - up . At 6-month follow - up , therapy with hyaluronic acid plus sodium clodronate was the most beneficial in terms of percentage improvement in VAS pain score . A significant improvement in ESR and CRP was observed at 6-month follow - up in each treatment group . No significant difference was observed when the percentage change from baseline related to these parameters was compared among the groups . No dropout was observed in any group . No serious adverse events were observed . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Further studies are necessary to determine the effect of a therapy based on hyaluronic acid combined with diclofenac sodium or sodium clodronate in larger cohorts of patients affected by knee osteoarthritis and in longer - term follow - up .",scaled attention,"group 1, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid alone (66 mg) into each knee; group 2, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus diclofenac sodium (5 mg) into each knee; || group 3, treated with an injection of hyaluronic acid (49.5 mg) plus sodium clodronate (5 mg) into each knee || erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)","[(423, 462)]",3,dev,scaled attention
181,5584005_8,5584005,"TITLE : Evaluation of a guided continuous quality improvement program in community pharmacies ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The importance of creating and sustaining a strong culture of patient safety has been recognized as a critical component of safe medication use . This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Guided CQI program implementation increased the self - reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff .

This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran . Data were collected using standard questionnaires , including the Elder Abuse - Knowledge Questionnaire , Health - Promoting Behavior Questionnaire , Health - Promoting Lifestyle Profile II , Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle , Perceived Social Support , Perceived Self - Efficacy , Loneliness Scale , Geriatric Depression Scale , Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale , and the SCARED ( stress , coping , argument , resources , events , and dependence ) tool . The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months . Data analysis were performed using χ2 tests , multiple linear and logistic regression , and structural equation modeling ( SEM ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse , self - efficacy , social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups . However , the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse ( 94.8 % in the intervention group and 46.6 % in the control group ) , high self - efficacy ( 82.8 % and 7.8 % , respectively ) , high social support ( 97.0 % and 10.3 % , respectively ) and high health promoting lifestyle ( 97.0 % and 10.3 % , respectively ) was significantly higher ( P<0.001 ) and the frequency of elder abuse risk ( 28.0 % and 49.6 % , respectively ) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention . SEM standardized beta ( Sβ ) showed that the intervention had the highest impact on increase social support ( Sβ=0.80 , β=48.64 , SE=1.70 , P<0.05 ) , self - efficacy ( Sβ=0.76 , β=13.32 , SE=0.52 , P<0.05 ) and health promoting behaviors ( Sβ=0.48 , β=33.08 , SE=2.26 , P<0.05 ) , respectively . The effect of the intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and significant ( Sβ=−0.406 , β=−0.340 , SE=0.03 , P<0.05 ) , and through social support , self - efficacy , and health promoting behaviors .

265,2645358_3,2645358,"TITLE : Reciprocal effects among changes in weight , body image , and other psychological factors during behavioral obesity treatment : a mediation analysis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Changes in body image and subjective well - being variables ( e.g. self - esteem ) are often reported as outcomes of obesity treatment . However , they may , in turn , also influence behavioral adherence and success in weight loss . The present study examined associations among obesity treatment - related variables , i.e. , change in weight , quality of life , body image , and subjective well - being , exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes , during a behavioral obesity treatment . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants ( BMI = 31.1 ± 4.1 kg / m2 ; age = 38.4 ± 6.7 y ) were 144 women who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program and a comparison group ( n = 49 ) , who received a general health education program . The intervention included regular group meetings promoting lasting behavior changes in physical activity and dietary intake . Body image , quality of life , subjective well - being , and body weight were measured at baseline and treatment 's end . Mediation was tested by multiple regression and a resampling approach to measure indirect effects . Treatment group assignment was the independent variable while changes in weight and in psychosocial variables were analyzed alternatively as mediators and as dependent variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 12 months , the intervention group had greater weight loss ( -5.6 ± 6.8 % vs. -1.2 ± 4.6 % , p < .001 ) and larger decreases in body size dissatisfaction ( effect size of 1.08 vs. .41 , p < .001 ) than the comparison group . Significant improvements were observed in both groups for all other psychosocial variables ( effect sizes ranging from .31–.75 , p < .05 ) . Mediation analysis showed that changes in body image and body weight were concurrently mediators and outcomes of treatment , suggesting reciprocal influences . Weight loss partially mediated the effect of treatment on quality of life and on self - esteem but the reciprocal effect was not observed . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Changes in weight and body image may reciprocally affect each other during the course of behavioral obesity treatment . No evidence of reciprocal relationships was found for the other models under analysis ; however , weight changes partially explained the effects of treatment on quality of life and self - esteem . Weight and psychosocial changes co - occur during treatment and will probably influence each other dynamically , in ways not yet adequately understood . Results from this study support the inclusion of intervention contents aimed at improving body image in weight management programs .",lime,Behavioral obesity treatment || Control || Body size dissatisfaction,"[(246, 296)]",5,dev,lime

We studied two different doses of neostigmine . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS & METHODS : : A randomized double blind study was conducted on ninety adult females scheduled for lower intra abdominal surgeries . The study was designed to compare two doses of epidural neostigmine co administered with lignocaine , with regard to its analgesic efficacy and its effect on sedation in postoperative period . Patients were divided into three groups of 30 each . Group I received lignocaine 1 % ( 9ml ) with normal saline ( 1ml ) , group II lignocaine1 % ( 9ml ) with neostigmine 100μg in saline ( 1ml ) and group III received lignocaine 1 % ( 9ml ) with neostigmine 200μg in NS ( 1ml ) . Group I served as a control . In operating room , after putting epidural catheter , general anesthesia was administered with propofol ( 2 mg kg-1 ) , succinylcholine ( 2 mg kg-1 ) and maintained with O2 , N2O , relaxant technique . At the end of surgery , patients were reversed . Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia . Intensity of pain relief on VAS , duration of analgesia , level of sensory block , motor blockade , sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia ( dose independent ) and sedation ( dose dependent ) . Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups . There was no incidence of respiratory depression , pruritus , bradycardia or hypotension in any group . Two patients in control group and one , receiving neostigmine ( 200μg ) , developed nausea / vomiting .

Previous studies emphasized cellular immune responses ; however , current research suggests both cellular and humoral responses are likely required for a successful therapeutic vaccine . Thus , we aimed to understand antibody response and function induced by vaccination of ART - treated HIV-1-infected patients with immune recovery . All subjects participated in EraMune 02 , an open - label randomized clinical trial of ART intensification followed by a six plasmid DNA prime ( envA , envB , envC , gagB , polB , nefB ) and rAd5 boost HIV vaccine with matching inserts . Antibody binding levels were determined with a recently developed microarray approach . We also analyzed neutralization efficiency and antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . We found that the DNA prime - rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross - clade HIV - specific antibody response , which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency . However , despite the increase in antibody binding levels , the vaccine did not significantly stimulate neutralization or ADCC responses . This finding was also reflected by a lack of change in total CD4 + cell associated HIV DNA in those who received the vaccine . Our results have important implications for further therapeutic vaccine design and administration , especially in HIV-1 infected patients , as boosting of preexisting antibody responses are unlikely to lead to clearance of latent proviruses in the HIV reservoir .",gradients,DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine || Control || HIV-specific antibody response,"[(183, 212)]",4,dev,gradients

This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web - based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored , evidence - based information and tools aimed to improve self - management of OA on self - management and change in knowledge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A quasi - experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period . The intervention provided participants with general and user - specific information , monthly assessments with validated instruments , and progress - tracking tools . A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self - assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires ( users : n=104 ; nonusers : n=91 ) . The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire ( heiQ ) to evaluate 8 different domains ( health - directed activity , positive and active engagement in life , emotional distress , self - monitoring and insight , constructive attitudes and approaches , skill and technique acquisition , social integration and support , health service navigation ) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator ( OAQI ) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants . Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi - square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender ( 152/195 , 77.9 % female ) , age ( mean 60 , SD 9 years ) and body mass index ( mean 31.1 , SD 6.8 kg / m2 ) . With the exception of health service navigation , mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers , although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance . Within - group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self - management ( absolute change score=15 % , P=.03 ) , lifestyle ( absolute change score=16 % , P=.02 ) , and physical activity ( absolute change score=11 % , P=.04 ) , with no significant improvements for the nonusers . Following 12 months of exposure to the website , there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self - management ( absolute change score 15 % vs 2 % , P=.001 ) and weight reduction ( absolute change scores 3 % vs – 6 % , P=.03 ) measured on the OAQI . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ , but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA . Further work is required to improve engagement with the website and the quality of information delivered in order to provide a greater impact .",scaled attention,"Website users || Nonusers || Weight reduction as measured on the OAQI, after 12 months","[(473, 519)]",3,dev,scaled attention
291,3897026_1,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

At the time of this study , artemether - lumefantrine ( AL ) and chlorproguanil - dapsone ( CPD ) , both multi - dose regimes , were considered possible alternatives to SP in Malawi . The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of poor adherence on the effectiveness of AL and CPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Children ≥12 months and adults with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive AL , CPD or SP . Adherence was measured using a questionnaire and electronic monitoring devices , MEMSTM , pill bottles that recorded the date and time of opening . Day-7 plasma dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations were measured to examine their relationship with adherence and clinical response . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 841 patients were recruited . The day-28 adequate clinical and parasitological response ( ACPR ) rates , using intention to treat analysis ( missing data treated as failure ) , were AL 85.2 % , CPD 63.7 % and SP 50 % . ACPR rates for AL were higher than CPD or SP on days 28 and 42 ( p ≤ 0.002 for all comparisons ) . CPD was more effective than SP on day-28 ( p = 0.01 ) , but not day-42 . Very high adherence was reported using the questionnaire , 100 % for AL treated patients and 99.2 % for the CPD group . Only three CPD participants admitted missing any doses . 164/181 ( 90.6 % ) of CPD treated patients took all their doses out of the MEMSTM container and they were more likely to have a day-28 ACPR than those who did not take all their medication out of the container , p = 0.024 . Only 7/87 ( 8 % ) AL treated patients did not take all of their doses out of their MEMSTM container and none had treatment failure . Median day-7 dapsone concentrations were higher in CPD treated patients with ACPR than in treatment failures , p = 0.012 . There were no differences in day-7 dapsone or lumefantrine concentrations between those who took all their doses from the MEMSTM container and those who did not . A day-7 lumefantrine concentration reported to be predictive of AL treatment failure in Thailand was not useful in this population ; only one of 16 participants with a concentration below this threshold ( 175 ng / ml ) had treatment failure .

The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario , Canada , and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Local public health agencies ( LPHA ) in Ontario , which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease , were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group . The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts . The control group continued with their pre - existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes . Outcomes were assessed using logbooks , which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received , investigation steps taken , and public health responses . The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months ( October 2013 to February 2015 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study ( n = 9 intervention group , n = 6 control group ) . A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs . Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA , in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit . Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts . LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action . Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year ( Year 1 versus Year 2 ) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert . Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more "" watchful waiting "" . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system . Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process , no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1 . It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response .",attention,Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol || Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes || Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year,"[(437, 454)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To determine outcomes for men diagnosed with advanced PCa following prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) testing who were excluded from the ProtecT randomised trial . ABSTRACT.DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Mortality was compared for 492 men followed up for a median of 7.4 yr to a contemporaneous cohort of men from the UK Anglia Cancer Network ( ACN ) and with a matched subset from the ACN . ABSTRACT.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : PCa - specific and all - cause mortality were compared using Kaplan - Meier analysis and Cox 's proportional hazards regression . ABSTRACT.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS : Of the 492 men excluded from the ProtecT cohort , 37 ( 8 % ) had metastases ( N1 , M0 = 5 , M1 = 32 ) and 305 had locally advanced disease ( 62 % ) . The median PSA was 17 μg / l . Treatments included radical prostatectomy ( RP ; n = 54 ; 11 % ) , radiotherapy ( RT ; n = 245 ; 50 % ) , androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ; n = 122 ; 25 % ) , other treatments ( n = 11 ; 2 % ) , and unknown ( n = 60 ; 12 % ) . There were 49 PCa - specific deaths ( 10 % ) , of whom 14 men had received radical treatment ( 5 % ) ; and 129 all - cause deaths ( 26 % ) . In matched ProtecT and ACN cohorts , 37 ( 9 % ) and 64 ( 16 % ) , respectively , died of PCa , while 89 ( 22 % ) and 103 ( 26 % ) died of all causes . ProtecT men had a 45 % lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases ( hazard ratio 0.55 , 95 % confidence interval 0.38–0.83 ; p = 0.0037 ) , but mortality was similar in those treated radically .

Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo , both on Day 1 and at Week 12 , with indacaterol - placebo differences ( LSM ± SEM ) of 190 ± 28 ( p < 0.001 ) and 160 ± 28 mL ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 ( between 5 min and 4 h , 5 min and 1 h , and 1 and 4 h post - dose ) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) , with LSM ( ± SEM ) differences of 170 ± 24 , 180 ± 24 , and 170 ± 24 mL , respectively . Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5 % ( p < 0.001 ) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication ( p < 0.001 ) . The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups ( indacaterol 49.3 % , placebo 46.8 % ) , with the most common AEs being COPD worsening ( indacaterol 8.5 % , placebo 12.2 % ) and cough ( indacaterol 6.2 % , placebo 7.3 % ) . One patient died in the placebo group . Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups , and no patient had QTc > 500 ms .

We investigated the effect of astaxanthin ( Asx ) supplementation on salivary IgA ( sIgA ) and oxidative stress status in plasma , along with changes in biochemical parameters and total / differential white cell counts . Forty trained male soccer players were randomly assigned to Asx and placebo groups . Asx group was supplemented with 4 mg of Asx . Saliva and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 90 days of supplementation in preexercise conditions . We observed a rise of sIgA levels at rest after 90 days of Asx supplementation , which was accompanied with a decrease in prooxidant - antioxidant balance . The plasma muscle enzymes levels were reduced significantly by Asx supplementation and by regular training . The increase in neutrophil count and hs - CRP level was found only in placebo group , indicating a significant blunting of the systemic inflammatory response in the subjects taking Asx . This study indicates that Asx supplementation improves sIgA response and attenuates muscle damage , thus preventing inflammation induced by rigorous physical training . Our findings also point that Asx could show significant physiologic modulation in individuals with mucosal immunity impairment or under conditions of increased oxidative stress and inflammation .",attention,placebo (P group) || baseline || neutrophil count,"[(168, 185)]",1,dev,attention

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns ' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub - Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining . We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource - limited setting . We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This study was an open label pragmatic cluster - randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation . 2550 pregnant women ( 1311 interventions and 1239 controls ) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery . 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care . The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text - message and voucher component . Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy . Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination , preventive treatment for malaria , gestational age at last antenatal care visit , and antepartum referral . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance . In the intervention group 44 % of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31 % in the control group ( OR , 2.39 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 5.55 ) . There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The wired mothers ' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services , more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred . Mobile phone applications may contribute towards improved maternal and newborn health and should be considered by policy makers in resource - limited settings .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 40 participants with type 1 diabetes , of whom 24 were adults [ mean ± standard deviation ( s.d . ) age 43 ± 12 years and glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 8.0 ± 0.9 % ] and 16 were adolescents ( mean ± s.d . age 15.6 ± 3.6 years and HbA1c 8.1 ± 0.8 % ) , underwent two periods of sensor‐augmented pump therapy in the home setting , in combination with or without an overnight closed‐loop insulin delivery system that uses a model predictive control algorithm to direct insulin delivery . The order of the two interventions was random ; each period lasted 4 weeks in adults and 3 weeks in adolescents . The primary outcome was time during which sensor glucose readings were in the target range of 3.9–8.0 mmol / l . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range ( 3.9–8.0 mmol / l ) overnight ( between 24:00 and 08:00 hours ) was 18.5 % greater during closed‐loop insulin delivery than during sensor‐augmented therapy ( p < 0.001 ) . Closed‐loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol / l ( p < 0.001 ) , with no difference in glycaemic variability , as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose . Time spent above the target range was reduced ( p = 0.001 ) , as was time spent in hypoglycaemia ( < 3.9 mmol / l ; p = 0.014 ) during closed‐loop therapy . Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed‐loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery ( p < 0.001 ) without changes to the total daily delivery ( p = 0.84 ) .

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar .

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity .

The optimum fluid regimen has not been established . This prospective , randomized , blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid ( hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution ( Hartmann 's Solution ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid ( N = 60 ) or crystalloid ( N = 60 ) intra - operatively . The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting . Patients were interviewed to assess nausea , vomiting , anti - emetic use , dizziness , sore throat , headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2 , 24 and 48 hours post operatively . Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea ( 38.2 % vs 17.9 % , P = 0.03 ) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively ( 1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2 , P = 0.028 ) . The incidence of vomiting and anti - emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups . Sore throat , dizziness , headache and general well being were not different between the groups .

662,5086025_1,5086025,"TITLE : Teaching Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Skills Via a Web - Based Intervention : A Pilot Single - Arm Intervention Study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Middle - aged women are at risk of weight gain and associated comorbidities . Deliberate restriction of food intake ( dieting ) produces short - term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long - term weight management . Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating ( ie , eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals ) and the development of greater psychological flexibility ( ie , the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ ACT ] ) . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : This pilot study investigated the usage , acceptability , and feasibility of "" Mind , Body , Food , "" a Web - based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants were 40 overweight women ( mean age 44.8 [ standard deviation , SD , 3.06 ] years , mean body mass index [ BMI ] 32.9 [ SD 6.01 ] kg / m2 , mean Intuitive Eating Scale [ IES-1 ] total score 53.4 [ SD 7.46 ] , classified as below average ) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin , New Zealand . Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics . Use of an online self - monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database . Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention . BMI , intuitive eating , binge eating , psychological flexibility , and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 40 women enrolled in the study , 12 ( 30 % ) completed all 12 modules ( median 7.5 [ interquartile range , IQR , 2 - 12 ] modules ) and 4 ( 10 % ) used the self - monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period ( median 3 [ IQR 1 - 9 ] weeks ) . Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments , most women rated "" Mind , Body , Food "" as useful ( 20/26 , 77 % ) , easy to use ( 17/25 , 68 % ) and liked the intervention ( 22/25 , 88 % ) . From pre- to postintervention , there were statistically significant within - group increases in intuitive eating ( IES-2 total score P<.001 ; all IES-2 subscale scores : P ≤.01 ) , psychological flexibility ( P=.01 ) , and general mental health ( P<.001 ) as well as significant decreases in binge eating ( P=.01 ) . At the 3-month follow - up , IES-2 improvements were maintained , and there were further improvements in binge eating ( P<.001 ) and general mental health ( P=.03 ) , and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility ( P=.06 ) . There were no significant within - group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow - up ( P=.46 and P=.93 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The "" Mind , Body , Food "" prototype Web - based intervention is appealing to middle - aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills , reduce binge eating , and maintain weight over 3 months . Further work to improve the user experience and engagement is required before testing the online intervention in a randomized controlled trial .",attention,Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy || Control || Psychological flexibility,"[(399, 454)]",1,dev,attention
611,3346068_0,3346068,"TITLE : Efficacy profile of liposome bupivacaine , a novel formulation of bupivacaine for postsurgical analgesia ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Liposome bupivacaine is a novel formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine , designed to provide prolonged postsurgical analgesia . This analysis examined pooled efficacy data as reflected in cumulative pain scores from 10 randomized , double - blind liposome bupivacaine clinical studies in which the study drug was administered via local wound infiltration . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 823 patients were exposed to liposome bupivacaine in 10 local wound infiltration studies at doses ranging from 66 mg to 532 mg in five surgical settings ; 446 patients received bupivacaine HCl ( dose : 75–200 mg ) and 190 received placebo . Efficacy measures were assessed through 72 hours after surgery . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Overall , 45 % of patients were male and 19 % were ≥65 years of age . In the analysis of cumulative pain intensity scores through 72 hours , liposome bupivacaine was associated with lower pain scores than the comparator in 16 of 19 treatment arms assessed , achieving statistically significant differences compared with bupivacaine HCl ( P < 0.05 ) in five of 17 treatment arms . These results were supported by results of other efficacy measures , including time to first use of opioid rescue medication , proportion of patients avoiding opioid rescue medication , total postsurgical consumption of opioid rescue medication , and patient / care provider satisfaction with postoperative analgesia . Local infiltration of liposome bupivacaine resulted in significant systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine , which could persist for 96 hours ; systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of liposome bupivacaine were not correlated with local efficacy . Liposome bupivacaine and bupivacaine HCl were generally well tolerated . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Based on this integrated analysis of multiple efficacy measures , liposome bupivacaine appears to be a potentially useful therapeutic option for prolonged reduction of postsurgical pain in soft tissue and orthopedic surgeries .",scaled attention,liposome bupivacaine || bupivacaine HCl || cumulative pain,"[(149, 199)]",3,dev,scaled attention

This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) .

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",scaled attention,vitamin A group || placebo group || serum iron,"[(208, 256)]",3,dev,scaled attention
374,2363753_0,2363753,"TITLE : A randomized trial of amifostine in patients with high - dose VIC chemotherapy plus autologous blood stem cell transplanation ABSTRACT : This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high - dose chemotherapy ( HD - VIC ) plus autologous bone marrow transplant ( HDCT ) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol - derivate amifostine . Additionally , the in - patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared . 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD - VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine ( 910 mg / m2 at day 1–3 ) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide . Patients were stratified according to pretreatment . HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin ( 500 mg / m2 / d over 18 h ) , ifosfamide ( 4 g / m2 / d over 4 h ) and etoposide ( 500 mg / m2 / d ) all given for 3 consecutive days . All patients received prophylactic application of G - CSF ( 5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously ) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment . Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity , gastrointestinal side effects , haematopoietic recovery , as well as frequency of fever and infections . The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was 10 % from baseline in the amifostine group ( 105 to 95 ml min−1 ) and 37 % in the control patient group ( 107 to 67 ml min−1 ) ( P < 0.01 ) . Amifostine - treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion . Stomatitis grade III / IV occurred in 25 % without versus 0 % of patients with amifostine ( P = 0.01 ) . Acute nausea / vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists / dexamethasone / trifluorpromazine . However , delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients . Engraftment of neutrophil ( > 500 μl−1 ) and thrombocytes ( > 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12 , respectively , both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm . In addition , a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm . The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30 % savings in costs for supportive care ( Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient ) . Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine , calculation of in - patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm . This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD - VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine . Additionally , a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine - treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned .

The present study is aimed at assessing ginger supplement and high - intensity interval training ( HIIT ) on inflammatory indices contributing to atherosclerosis in overweight women . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The present study is a randomized , experimental , and controlled one in which thirty healthy overweight women aged 20–30 years were randomly divided into three equal groups , namely , ginger , ginger + HIIT , and placebo + HIIT . The training groups performed high - intensity interval exercises ( i.e. 40-m maximal shuttle run ) for ten consecutive weeks . The supplement groups daily took 3 g of ginger pills and the third group took placebo . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Paired t - test revealed a significant decrease in the density of type 1 monocytes chemo tactic protein ( MCP-1 ) in HIIT + ginger ( P = 0.026 ) and HIIT + placebo ( P = 0.001 ) groups . Besides , maximum aerobic capacity in the two training groups significantly increased P = 0.002 and P = 0.000 , respectively .

We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time .

This paradigm might serve as a translational model for ( pre)attentive information processing deficits in schizophrenia . This is the first study to investigate the event - related potentials ( ERPs ) of a within - subject LIrr paradigm in humans . Furthermore , the effects of the muscarinic M1 antagonist biperiden on LIrr were assessed . As expected , LIrr was found to be intact in young healthy volunteers after placebo . Furthermore , in the placebo condition P3b latency was decreased for target stimuli , which were pre - cued . This suggests that the predictability of the occurrence of these stimuli is mainly reflected by this ERP component . Biperiden had no effect on the behavioural LIrr measures , although prolonged reaction times were evident . Biperiden increased the N1 amplitude of the pre - exposed predictor letters , suggesting an effect of this drug on early perceptual processing . In conclusion , the within - subject paradigm used in the current study in combination with electroencephalography can reveal brain mechanisms involved in LIrr . M1 antagonism did not affect LIrr performance but seemed to influence early information processing .",scaled attention,Biperiden || Placebo || Learned irrelevance index,"[(159, 169)]",3,dev,scaled attention

This study aims to determine the cost - effectiveness of the COACH program in comparison with usual care from a societal perspective . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A controlled clinical trial was performed at the Internal Medicine department of a general teaching hospital . All admitted patients using at least one prescription drug were included . The COACH program consisted of medication reconciliation , patient counselling at discharge , and communication to healthcare providers in primary care . The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an unplanned rehospitalisation within three months after discharge . Also , the number of quality - adjusted life - years ( QALYs ) was assessed . Cost data were collected using cost diaries . Uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost - effectiveness ratios between the groups was estimated by bootstrapping . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the COACH program , 168 patients were included and in usual care 151 patients . There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with unplanned rehospitalisations ( mean difference 0.17 % , 95 % CI -8.85;8.51 ) , and in QALYs ( mean difference -0.0085 , 95 % CI -0.0170;0.0001 ) . Total costs for the COACH program were non - significantly lower than usual care ( -€1160 , 95 % CI -3168;847 ) . Cost - effectiveness planes showed that the program was not cost - effective compared with usual care for unplanned rehospitalisations and QALYs gained . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The COACH program was not cost - effective in comparison with usual care .

563,5311860_0,5311860,"TITLE : Evaluation of the ability of standardized supports to improve public health response to syndromic surveillance for respiratory diseases in Canada ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Despite widespread implementation of syndromic surveillance systems within public health agencies , previous studies of the implementation and use of these systems have indicated that the functions and responses taken in response to syndromic surveillance data vary widely according to local context and preferences . The objective of the Syndromic Surveillance Evaluation Study was to develop and implement standardized supports in local public health agencies in Ontario , Canada , and evaluate the ability of these supports to affect actions taken as part of public health communicable disease control programs . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Local public health agencies ( LPHA ) in Ontario , which used syndromic surveillance based on emergency department visits for respiratory disease , were recruited and randomly allocated to the study intervention or control group . The intervention group health agencies received standardized supports in terms of a standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and a response protocol dictating steps to investigate and assess the public health significance of syndromic surveillance alerts . The control group continued with their pre - existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes . Outcomes were assessed using logbooks , which collected quantitative and qualitative information about alerts received , investigation steps taken , and public health responses . The study was conducted prospectively for 15 months ( October 2013 to February 2015 ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Fifteen LPHAs participated in the study ( n = 9 intervention group , n = 6 control group ) . A total of 1,969 syndromic surveillance alerts were received by all LPHAs . Variations in the types and amount of responses varied by LPHA , in particularly differences were noted by the size of the health unit . Smaller health units had more challenges to both detect and mount a response to any alerts . LPHAs in the control group were more likely to declare alerts to have public health significance and to initiate any action . Regression models using repeated measures showed an interaction between the year ( Year 1 versus Year 2 ) and the intervention as well as an interaction between year and sustained nature of the alert . Both of these were linked to the control health units reporting more "" watchful waiting "" . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This study raises questions about the effectiveness of using standardized protocols to improve the performance of syndromic surveillance in a decentralized public health system . Despite efforts to create standardized protocols and engage public health agencies in the process , no significant differences in the effective use of syndromic alerts were observed beyond year 1 . It also raises questions about the minimum capacity of the agency and minimum population size that are required for an effective response .",attention,Standardized aberrant event detection algorithm and response protocol || Pre-existing syndromic surveillance infrastructure and processes || Effective use of syndromic alerts after 1 year,"[(423, 454)]",1,dev,attention

Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA . RESULTS — The load group reached a peak in free insulin value ( 460 μU / ml ) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 μU / ml in 60 min . The twice no load group reached a peak ( 200 μU / ml ) at 45 min . The no load group reached a peak ( 60 μU / ml ) in 60–120 min . Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10 % ; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not . Except for these differences , times to reach glucose ≤250 mg / dl , pH ≥7.3 , and HCO3− ≥15 mEq / l did not differ significantly among the three groups . CONCLUSIONS — A priming dose in low - dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit · kg body weight−1 · h−1 ( about 10 units / h in a 70-kg patient ) is given .",scaled attention,Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion || Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion || Time for reaching bicarbonate predetermined values,"[(295, 323)]",3,dev,scaled attention

228,5571924_2,5571924,"TITLE : A prediction model for advanced colorectal neoplasia in an asymptomatic screening population ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : An electronic medical record ( EMR ) database of a large unselected population who received screening colonoscopies may minimize sampling error and represent real - world estimates of risk for screening target lesions of advanced colorectal neoplasia ( CRN ) . Our aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for assessing the probability of advanced CRN using a clinical data warehouse . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 49,450 screenees underwent their first colonoscopy as part of a health check - up from 2002 to 2012 at Samsung Medical Center , and the dataset was constructed by means of natural language processing from the computerized EMR system . The screenees were randomized into training and validation sets . The prediction model was developed using logistic regression . The model performance was validated and compared with existing models using area under receiver operating curve ( AUC ) analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the training set , age , gender , smoking duration , drinking frequency , and aspirin use were identified as independent predictors for advanced CRN ( adjusted P < .01 ) . The developed model had good discrimination ( AUC = 0.726 ) and was internally validated ( AUC = 0.713 ) . The high - risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the low - risk group ( 1.1 % vs. 4.0 % , P < .001 ) . The discrimination performance of the present model for high - risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the Asia - Pacific Colorectal Screening score ( AUC = 0.678 , P < .001 ) and Schroy 's CAN index ( AUC = 0.672 , P < .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The present 5-item risk model can be calculated readily using a simple questionnaire and can identify the low- and high - risk groups of advanced CRN at the first screening colonoscopy . This model may increase colorectal cancer risk awareness and assist healthcare providers in encouraging the high - risk group to undergo a colonoscopy .",attention,high-risk group || low-risk group || advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRN),"[(221, 253)]",1,dev,attention

Question asking is one way in which patients can be active . We investigated 2 means of promoting cancer patient question asking . One was the provision of a question prompt sheet to patients prior to their initial consultation with their oncologist . The second was the active endorsement and systematic review of the question prompt sheet by their oncologist . 318 patients with heterogeneous cancers , seeing one of 5 medical and 4 radiation oncologists for the first time , were randomised to either receive or not receive a question prompt sheet . Doctors were randomised to either proactively address or passively respond to the question prompt sheet in the subsequent consultation . Anxiety was assessed prior to the consultation . Consultations were audiotaped and content analysed . Anxiety was assessed again immediately following the consultation . Within the next 10 days patients completed questionnaires assessing information needs , anxiety and satisfaction and were given a structured telephone interview assessing information recall . Patients provided with a question prompt sheet asked more questions about prognosis compared with controls and oncologists gave significantly more prognostic information to these patients . Provision of the question prompt sheet prolonged consultations and increased patient anxiety ; however , when oncologists specifically addressed the prompt sheet , anxiety levels were significantly reduced , consultation duration was decreased and recall was significantly improved . A patient question prompt sheet , used proactively by the doctor , is a powerful addition to the oncology consultation . © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign",attention,Patients who received a question prompt sheet || Patients who didn't receive a question prompt sheet || Prognosis enquiry,"[(195, 221)]",1,dev,attention
174,5584005_1,5584005,"TITLE : Evaluation of a guided continuous quality improvement program in community pharmacies ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The importance of creating and sustaining a strong culture of patient safety has been recognized as a critical component of safe medication use . This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) .

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity . We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time .

323,4310883_3,4310883,"TITLE : Alvimopan : A cost – effective tool to decrease cystectomy length of stay ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of perioperative use of alvimopan in cystectomy and urinary diversion . A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy ; however , a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : Eighty – six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012 . The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively , while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The groups were equal with respect to age , gender , indication , surgeon , and type of diversion . Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay ( LOS ) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan ( 10.5 vs. 8.6 days , p = 0.005 , 95 % CI 0.6–3.3 ) . Readmission for ileus was low in both alvimopan and control groups ( 0 % and 4.4 % , respectively ) . Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups ( 2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p < 0.001 ) . This difference stood up to multivariate analysis with a $ 7,062 difference in hospital stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Use of alvimopan in the routine perioperative care of our cystectomy and urinary diversion patients has decreased LOS by 1.9 days . Additionally , institution of routine perioperative alvimopan has reduced costs by $ 7,062 per admission ( 20 % reduction ) .

We investigated the possible effects of Bifidobacterium animalisssp . lactis 420 ( B420 ) and the dietary fiber Litesse ® Ultra polydextrose ( LU ) on body fat mass and other obesity - related parameters . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 225 healthy volunteers ( healthy , BMI 28–34.9 ) were randomized into four groups ( 1:1:1:1 ) , using a computer - generated sequence , for 6 months of double - blind , parallel treatment : 1 ) Placebo , microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 2 ) LU , 12 g / d ; 3 ) B420 , 1010 CFU / d in microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 4 ) LU + B420 , 12 g + 1010 CFU / d . Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",gradients,Bifidobacterium animalisssp.lactis 420 || Placebo || Energy intake,"[(456, 492)]",4,dev,gradients

There were 49 PCa - specific deaths ( 10 % ) , of whom 14 men had received radical treatment ( 5 % ) ; and 129 all - cause deaths ( 26 % ) . In matched ProtecT and ACN cohorts , 37 ( 9 % ) and 64 ( 16 % ) , respectively , died of PCa , while 89 ( 22 % ) and 103 ( 26 % ) died of all causes . ProtecT men had a 45 % lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases ( hazard ratio 0.55 , 95 % confidence interval 0.38–0.83 ; p = 0.0037 ) , but mortality was similar in those treated radically . The nonrandomised design is a limitation . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Men with PSA - detected advanced PCa excluded from ProtecT and treated radically had low rates of PCa death at 7.4-yr follow - up . Among men who underwent nonradical treatment , the ProtecT group had a lower rate of PCa death . Early detection through PSA testing , leadtime bias , and group heterogeneity are possible factors in this finding . ABSTRACT.PATIENT SUMMARY : Prostate cancer that has spread outside the prostate gland without causing symptoms can be detected via prostate - specific antigen testing and treated , leading to low rates of death from this disease .",lime,ProtecT trial patients || Patients excluded from the ProtecT || Risk of death from PCa,"[(334, 366)]",5,dev,lime

226,5571924_0,5571924,"TITLE : A prediction model for advanced colorectal neoplasia in an asymptomatic screening population ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : An electronic medical record ( EMR ) database of a large unselected population who received screening colonoscopies may minimize sampling error and represent real - world estimates of risk for screening target lesions of advanced colorectal neoplasia ( CRN ) . Our aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for assessing the probability of advanced CRN using a clinical data warehouse . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 49,450 screenees underwent their first colonoscopy as part of a health check - up from 2002 to 2012 at Samsung Medical Center , and the dataset was constructed by means of natural language processing from the computerized EMR system . The screenees were randomized into training and validation sets . The prediction model was developed using logistic regression . The model performance was validated and compared with existing models using area under receiver operating curve ( AUC ) analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the training set , age , gender , smoking duration , drinking frequency , and aspirin use were identified as independent predictors for advanced CRN ( adjusted P < .01 ) . The developed model had good discrimination ( AUC = 0.726 ) and was internally validated ( AUC = 0.713 ) . The high - risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the low - risk group ( 1.1 % vs. 4.0 % , P < .001 ) . The discrimination performance of the present model for high - risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the Asia - Pacific Colorectal Screening score ( AUC = 0.678 , P < .001 ) and Schroy 's CAN index ( AUC = 0.672 , P < .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The present 5-item risk model can be calculated readily using a simple questionnaire and can identify the low- and high - risk groups of advanced CRN at the first screening colonoscopy . This model may increase colorectal cancer risk awareness and assist healthcare providers in encouraging the high - risk group to undergo a colonoscopy .",attention,high-risk group || low-risk group || advanced colorectal neoplasia (CRN),"[(221, 253)]",1,dev,attention
161,3687261_2,3687261,"TITLE : Effects of a ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Macronutrient "" preloads "" can reduce postprandial glycemia by slowing gastric emptying and stimulating glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion . An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) .

355,4237335_1,4237335,"TITLE : Health on the Web : Randomised Controlled Trial of Online Screening and Brief Alcohol Intervention Delivered in a Workplace Setting ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Alcohol misuse in England costs around £ 7.3 billion ( US$ 12.2 billion ) annually from lost productivity and absenteeism . Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable , particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour . Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak . The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption , delivered in a workplace as part of a health check . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : This two - group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK - based private sector organisation ( approx . 100,000 employees ) . 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period . Of these , 1,330 ( 39 % ) scored five or more on the AUDIT - C ( indicating alcohol misuse ) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake , alongside feedback on other health behaviours ( n = 659 ) , or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake ( n = 671 ) . Participants were mostly male ( 75 % ) , with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions ( 55 % ) . Median Body Mass Index was 26 , 12 % were smokers , median time undertaking moderate / vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day . Eighty percent ( n = 1,066 ) of participants completed follow - up questionnaires at three months . An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking ( primary outcome ) ( 5.6 % increase associated with the intervention ( 95 % CI −4.7 % to 16.9 % ; p = .30 ) ) , AUDIT ( measure of alcohol - related harm ) and health utility ( EQ-5D ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation .

ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifty - eight patients with gastric neoplasias scheduled for gastric ESD were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two groups . The satisfaction scores of the endoscopists and the parameters for the effectiveness and safety of sedation were evaluated by comparisons between the two groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The satisfaction scores of the endoscopists , which were measured using a visual analogue scale , were significantly higher in the Combination group than in the PF group ( 88 vs. 69 , P = 0.003 ) . The maintenance dose of PF was lower in the Combination group than in the PF group ( 2 mg / kg / h vs. 5 mg / kg / h , P < 0.001 ) , and the number of rescue PF injections was fewer in the Combination group than in the PF group ( 2 times vs. 6 times , P < 0.001 ) . The incidence of bradycardia ( defined as a pulse rate ≤ 45 bpm ) in the Combination group was higher than that in the PF group ( 37.9 % vs. 10.3 % , P = 0.029 ) .

208,4048141_0,4048141,"TITLE : Clinical Relevance of Vilazodone Treatment in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder : Categorical Improvement in Symptoms ABSTRACT : Objective : To assess clinically relevant symptom improvement in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) receiving vilazodone by using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , a clinician - rated scale used to measure MDD symptom severity and improvement . Method : Pooled data from 2 positive , phase 3 , 8-week , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trials in patients with MDD were analyzed . Patients received vilazodone 40 mg / d or placebo ; post hoc analyses were conducted on study completers . Depression symptom improvement was evaluated by analyzing the proportions of patients who shifted from the baseline MADRS single - item symptom severity category of ≥ 2 ( mild to severe symptoms ) to an end - of - study category < 2 ( minimal to no symptoms ) or from ≥ 4 ( moderate to severe symptoms ) to ≤ 2 ( mild to no symptoms ) . The proportion of patients who shifted from anxious depression to no anxious depression was also analyzed . Results : The percentage of patients who completed these studies with severity category shift from baseline ≥ 2 to end of study < 2 was significantly higher for vilazodone versus placebo on all MADRS items ( odds ratio [ OR ] range , 1.4–1.7 , P < .05 ) except reduced appetite ( OR = 1.3 , P = .232 ) . A significantly greater proportion of vilazodone - treated versus placebo - treated patients shifted from baseline ≥ 4 to end of study ≤ 2 on MADRS items of apparent sadness , reported sadness , inner tension , reduced sleep , and lassitude ( OR range , 1.5–2.0 , P < .05 ) . Additionally , a significantly greater proportion of vilazodone - treated versus placebo - treated patients shifted from anxious depression at baseline to no anxious depression at end of study ( OR = 1.5 , P = .031 ) . Conclusions : These results suggest that vilazodone treatment is associated with clinically relevant changes in depression symptoms in patients with MDD .

The optimal framework to categorize clinical trials according to risk remains unclear , however . Switzerland is the first European country to adopt a risk - based categorization procedure in January 2014 . We assessed how accurately and consistently clinical trials are categorized using two different approaches : an approach using criteria set forth in the new law ( concept ) or an intuitive approach ( ad hoc ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : This was a randomized controlled trial with a method - comparison study nested in each arm . We used clinical trial protocols from eight Swiss ethics committees approved between 2010 and 2011 . Protocols were randomly assigned to be categorized in one of three risk categories using the concept or the ad hoc approach . Each protocol was independently categorized by the trial 's sponsor , a group of experts and the approving ethics committee . The primary outcome was the difference in categorization agreement between the expert group and sponsors across arms . Linear weighted kappa was used to quantify agreements , with the difference between kappas being the primary effect measure . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : We included 142 of 231 protocols in the final analysis ( concept = 78 ; ad hoc = 64 ) . Raw agreement between the expert group and sponsors was 0.74 in the concept and 0.78 in the ad hoc arm . Chance - corrected agreement was higher in the ad hoc ( kappa : 0.34 ( 95 % confidence interval = 0.10–0.58 ) ) than in the concept arm ( 0.27 ( 0.06–0.50 ) ) , but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.67 ) . ABSTRACT.LIMITATIONS : : The main limitation was the large number of protocols excluded from the analysis mostly because they did not fit with the clinical trial definition of the new law . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : A structured risk categorization approach was not better than an ad hoc approach . Laws introducing risk - based approaches should provide guidelines , examples and templates to ensure correct application .",ig,New law criteria (Concept) || Intuitive approach (ad hoc) || Agreement between Experts and Sponsors,"[(261, 329)]",0,dev,ig

Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 40 participants with type 1 diabetes , of whom 24 were adults [ mean ± standard deviation ( s.d . ) age 43 ± 12 years and glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 8.0 ± 0.9 % ] and 16 were adolescents ( mean ± s.d . age 15.6 ± 3.6 years and HbA1c 8.1 ± 0.8 % ) , underwent two periods of sensor‐augmented pump therapy in the home setting , in combination with or without an overnight closed‐loop insulin delivery system that uses a model predictive control algorithm to direct insulin delivery . The order of the two interventions was random ; each period lasted 4 weeks in adults and 3 weeks in adolescents . The primary outcome was time during which sensor glucose readings were in the target range of 3.9–8.0 mmol / l . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range ( 3.9–8.0 mmol / l ) overnight ( between 24:00 and 08:00 hours ) was 18.5 % greater during closed‐loop insulin delivery than during sensor‐augmented therapy ( p < 0.001 ) . Closed‐loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol / l ( p < 0.001 ) , with no difference in glycaemic variability , as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose . Time spent above the target range was reduced ( p = 0.001 ) , as was time spent in hypoglycaemia ( < 3.9 mmol / l ; p = 0.014 ) during closed‐loop therapy . Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed‐loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery ( p < 0.001 ) without changes to the total daily delivery ( p = 0.84 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Overnight closed‐loop insulin therapy at home in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is feasible , showing improvements in glucose control and reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia .",scaled attention,Closed‐loop insulin || Control || Time at target range,"[(201, 245)]",3,dev,scaled attention

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in - between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk . Twenty - six healthy adults ( 24.7 ± 3.2 y ; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg / m2 ) participated in a 4-week cross - over intervention and consumed orange juice ( 20 % of energy requirement ) either together with 3 meals / d ( WM ) or in - between 3 meals / d ( BM ) at ad libitum energy intake . Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity ( primary outcome ) , daylong glycaemia , glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed . Body fat mass was measured by air - displacement plethysmography . After BM - intervention , fat mass increased ( +1.0 ± 1.8 kg ; p < 0.05 ) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease ( ΔMatsudaISI : −0.89 ± 2.3 ; p = 0.06 ) . By contrast , after WM - intervention fat mass and gamma - glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) decreased ( −0.30 ± 0.65 kg ; −2.50 ± 3.94 ; both p < 0.05 ) , whereas glucose variability was higher ( ΔMAGE : +0.45 ± 0.59 , p < 0.05 ) . Daylong glycaemia , insulin secretion , changes in basal insulin sensitivity , and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM - interventions ( all p > 0.05 ) .

A report from the Dutch Neuro - Oncology Group BELOB trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Angiogenesis is crucial for glioblastoma growth , and anti - vascular endothelial growth factor agents are widely used in recurrent glioblastoma patients . The number of circulating endothelial cells ( CECs ) is a surrogate marker for endothelial damage . We assessed their kinetics and explored their prognostic value in patients with recurrent glioblastoma . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : In this side study of the BELOB trial , 141 patients with recurrent glioblastoma were randomised to receive single - agent bevacizumab or lomustine , or bevacizumab plus lomustine . Before treatment , after 4 weeks and after 6 weeks of treatment , CECs were enumerated . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The number of CECs increased during treatment with bevacizumab plus lomustine , but not during treatment in the single - agent arms . In patients treated with lomustine single agent , higher absolute CEC numbers after 4 weeks ( log10CEC hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.41 , 95 % CI 0.18–0.91 ) and 6 weeks ( log10CEC HR 0.16 , 95 % CI 0.05–0.56 ) of treatment were associated with improved overall survival ( OS ) . Absolute CEC numbers in patients receiving bevacizumab plus lomustine or bevacizumab single agent were not associated with OS . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : CEC numbers increased during treatment with bevacizumab plus lomustine but not during treatment with either agent alone , suggesting that this combination induced the greatest vascular damage . Although the absolute number of CECs was not associated with OS in patients treated with bevacizumab either alone or in combination , they could serve as a marker in glioblastoma patients receiving lomustine single agent .",attention,lomustine || baseline || circulating endothelial cells (CECs) after 4 and 6 weeks,"[(151, 174)]",1,dev,attention

The optimum fluid regimen has not been established . This prospective , randomized , blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid ( hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution ( Hartmann 's Solution ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid ( N = 60 ) or crystalloid ( N = 60 ) intra - operatively . The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting . Patients were interviewed to assess nausea , vomiting , anti - emetic use , dizziness , sore throat , headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2 , 24 and 48 hours post operatively . Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea ( 38.2 % vs 17.9 % , P = 0.03 ) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively ( 1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2 , P = 0.028 ) . The incidence of vomiting and anti - emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups . Sore throat , dizziness , headache and general well being were not different between the groups . A comparable reduction on post - operative FVC and FEV-1 and PEFR was observed in both groups .

Question asking is one way in which patients can be active . We investigated 2 means of promoting cancer patient question asking . One was the provision of a question prompt sheet to patients prior to their initial consultation with their oncologist . The second was the active endorsement and systematic review of the question prompt sheet by their oncologist . 318 patients with heterogeneous cancers , seeing one of 5 medical and 4 radiation oncologists for the first time , were randomised to either receive or not receive a question prompt sheet . Doctors were randomised to either proactively address or passively respond to the question prompt sheet in the subsequent consultation . Anxiety was assessed prior to the consultation . Consultations were audiotaped and content analysed . Anxiety was assessed again immediately following the consultation . Within the next 10 days patients completed questionnaires assessing information needs , anxiety and satisfaction and were given a structured telephone interview assessing information recall . Patients provided with a question prompt sheet asked more questions about prognosis compared with controls and oncologists gave significantly more prognostic information to these patients . Provision of the question prompt sheet prolonged consultations and increased patient anxiety ; however , when oncologists specifically addressed the prompt sheet , anxiety levels were significantly reduced , consultation duration was decreased and recall was significantly improved .

359,4491277_1,4491277,"TITLE : Intrauterine administration of human chorionic gonadotropin does not improve pregnancy and life birth rates independently of blastocyst quality : a randomised prospective study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Successful embryo implantation depends on a well - timed maternal - embryonic crosstalk . Human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) secreted by the embryo is known to play a key role in this process and to trigger a complex signal transduction cascade allowing the apposition , attachment , and invasion of the embryo into the decidualized uterus . Production of hCG was reported to be dependent on blastocyst quality and several articles suggested that intrauterine hCG injection increases pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF patients . However , no study has as yet analysed birth rates as final outcome . Our objective was to determine whether clinical outcome after blastocyst transfer can be improved by intrauterine injection of hCG and whether this is dependent on blastocyst quality . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective randomised study was conducted in two settings . In cohort A , hCG application was performed two days before blastocyst transfer . In cohort B , the administration of hCG occurred just prior to embryo transfer on day 5 . For both cohorts , patients were randomised to either intrauterine hCG application or to the control group that received culture medium . Clinical outcome was analysed according to blastocyst quality of transferred embryos . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The outcome of 182 IVF - cycles ( cohort A ) and 1004 IVF - cycles ( cohort B ) was analysed . All patients received a fresh autologous blastocyst transfer on day five . Primary outcomes were pregnancy rates ( PR ) , clinical pregnancy rates ( cPR ) , miscarriage rates ( MR ) , and live birth rates ( LBR ) . No improvement of clinical outcome after intrauterine hCG administration on day 3 ( cohort A ) or day 5 ( cohort B ) was found , independently of blastocyst quality transferred . The final outcome in cohort A : LBR after transfer of top blastocysts was 50.0 % with hCG and 53.3 % in the control group . With non - top blastocysts , LBR of 17.1 % ( hCG ) and 18.2 % ( control ) were observed ( n.s . ) . In cohort B , LBR with top blastocysts was 53.3 % ( hCG ) and 48.4 % ( control ) , with non - top blastocysts it came to 28.7 % ( hCG ) and 35.0 % ( control ) . The differences between the groups were statistically not significant . Furthermore , we investigated a possible benefit of hCG administration in correlation with female age . In both age groups ( < 38 years and ≥ 38 years ) we found similar LBR after treatment with hCG vs. medium . A LBR of 47.1 % vs. 48.7 % was obtained in the younger group and 26.6 % vs. 30.8 % in the older group .

The treatment of choice is nonsedating antihistamines , dosages of which may be increased up to fourfold if standard doses are ineffective . Here , we assess the effects of a standard 20 mg dose and up - dosing to 40 and 80 mg of bilastine in reducing the symptoms of CCU and inflammatory mediator release following cold challenge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty patients with CCU were included in this randomized , crossover , double - blind , placebo - controlled 12-week study . They received placebo , 20 , 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods . The primary readout was change in critical temperature thresholds ( CTT ) . Secondary readouts were changes in pruritus , levels of histamine IL-6 , IL-8 and TNF - α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective ( P < 0.0001 ) in reducing CTT . Up - dosing to 80 mg significantly ( P < 0.04 ) increased its effectiveness . At this dose , 19 of 20 ( 95 % ) patients responded to treatment , with 12 of 20 ( 60 % ) becoming symptom free . Only one patient was refractory to treatment . Microdialysis levels of histamine , IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) decreased following up - dosing with 80 mg bilastine .

Deliberate restriction of food intake ( dieting ) produces short - term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long - term weight management . Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating ( ie , eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals ) and the development of greater psychological flexibility ( ie , the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ ACT ] ) . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : This pilot study investigated the usage , acceptability , and feasibility of "" Mind , Body , Food , "" a Web - based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants were 40 overweight women ( mean age 44.8 [ standard deviation , SD , 3.06 ] years , mean body mass index [ BMI ] 32.9 [ SD 6.01 ] kg / m2 , mean Intuitive Eating Scale [ IES-1 ] total score 53.4 [ SD 7.46 ] , classified as below average ) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin , New Zealand . Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics . Use of an online self - monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database . Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention . BMI , intuitive eating , binge eating , psychological flexibility , and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 40 women enrolled in the study , 12 ( 30 % ) completed all 12 modules ( median 7.5 [ interquartile range , IQR , 2 - 12 ] modules ) and 4 ( 10 % ) used the self - monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period ( median 3 [ IQR 1 - 9 ] weeks ) . Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments , most women rated "" Mind , Body , Food "" as useful ( 20/26 , 77 % ) , easy to use ( 17/25 , 68 % ) and liked the intervention ( 22/25 , 88 % ) . From pre- to postintervention , there were statistically significant within - group increases in intuitive eating ( IES-2 total score P<.001 ; all IES-2 subscale scores : P ≤.01 ) , psychological flexibility ( P=.01 ) , and general mental health ( P<.001 ) as well as significant decreases in binge eating ( P=.01 ) . At the 3-month follow - up , IES-2 improvements were maintained , and there were further improvements in binge eating ( P<.001 ) and general mental health ( P=.03 ) , and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility ( P=.06 ) . There were no significant within - group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow - up ( P=.46 and P=.93 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The "" Mind , Body , Food "" prototype Web - based intervention is appealing to middle - aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills , reduce binge eating , and maintain weight over 3 months .

We developed a highly - structured manualized eight - session cognitive - behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists ( tCBT ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We conducted a parallel - group , non - blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre - existing Employee Assistance Program ( EAP ) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan . The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory - II ( BDI - II ) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire ( HPQ ) . In the course of the trial the follow - up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual . Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP ( n = 58 ) and to EAP alone ( n = 60 ) . The BDI - II scores fell from the mean of 17.3 at baseline to 11.0 in the intervention group and to 15.7 in the control group after 4 months ( p<0.001 , Effect size = 0.69 , 95%CI : 0.32 to 1.05 ) .

245,3564932_6,3564932,"TITLE : Outpatient Foley catheter versus inpatient prostaglandin E2 gel for induction of labour : a randomised trial ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Induction of labour ( IOL ) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions , with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery . Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : OPC was feasible and acceptable for IOL of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to IP , however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin IOL .

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index ( GI ) and anti - hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats . Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) . No significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) in insulin , cholesterol measurements ( total cholesterol , LDL - C , HDL - C , triglycerides and cholesterol ratios ) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed . All other measurements ( AST , ALT , ALP , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c ( p > 0.05 ) of type 2 diabetic patients . The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested . Therefore , the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients .",attention,Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) || Any other food || Fasting blood glucose,"[(374, 419)]",1,dev,attention

164,3687261_5,3687261,"TITLE : Effects of a ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Macronutrient "" preloads "" can reduce postprandial glycemia by slowing gastric emptying and stimulating glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion . An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In type 2 diabetes , acute administration of a d - xylose preload reduces postprandial glycemia and enhances the effect of a DPP-4 inhibitor .",attention,d-xylose || sucralose || plasma GLP-1 before consuming the meal,"[(267, 287)]",1,dev,attention
299,5156604_0,5156604,"TITLE : Memorizing fruit : The effect of a fruit memory - game on children 's fruit intake ABSTRACT : Food cues of palatable food are omnipresent , thereby simulating the intake of unhealthy snack food among children . As a consequence , this might lead to a higher intake of energy - dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables , a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases . The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children . We used a randomized between - subject design with 127 children ( age : 7–12 y ) who played a memory - game , containing either fruit ( n = 64 ) or non - food products ( n = 63 ) . While playing the memory - game in a separate room in school during school hours , free intake of fruit ( mandarins , apples , bananas , and grapes ) was measured . Afterwards , the children completed self - report measures , and length and weight were assessed . The main finding is that playing a memory - game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake ( P = 0.016 ) . Children who played the fruit version of the memory - game ate more bananas ( P = 0.015 ) and mandarins ( P = 0.036 ) than children who played the non - food memory - game ; no effects were found for apples ( P > 0.05 ) and grapes ( P > 0.05 ) . The findings suggest that playing a memory - game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children . This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit , according to international standards , and more traditional health interventions have limited success . Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults , making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way .

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity .

541,3460347_0,3460347,"TITLE : Nicotine , Auditory Sensory Memory , and ABSTRACT : Background : The procognitive actions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) agonist nicotine are believed , in part , to motivate the excessive cigarette smoking in schizophrenia , a disorder associated with deficits in multiple cognitive domains , including low - level auditory sensory processes and higher - order attention - dependent operations . Objectives : As N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) hypofunction has been shown to contribute to these cognitive impairments , the primary aims of this healthy volunteer study were to : ( a ) to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of nAChR and NMDAR systems in the modulation of auditory sensory memory ( and sustained attention ) , as indexed by the auditory event - related brain potential – mismatch negativity ( MMN ) , and ( b ) to examine how these effects are moderated by a predisposition to auditory hallucinations / delusions ( HD ) . Methods : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled design involving a low intravenous dose of ketamine ( 0.04 mg / kg ) and a 4 mg dose of nicotine gum , MMN , and performance on a rapid visual information processing ( RVIP ) task of sustained attention were examined in 24 healthy controls psychometrically stratified as being lower ( L - HD , n = 12 ) or higher ( H - HD ) for HD propensity . Results : Ketamine significantly slowed MMN , and reduced MMN in H - HD , with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co - administration of nicotine . Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [ reaction time ( RT ) ] and accuracy ( increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms ) on the RVIP , with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine . Both % hits and d′ , as well as RT were poorer in H - HD ( vs. L - HD ) and while hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H - HD , RT was slowed by ketamine in L - HD . Conclusions : Nicotine alleviated ketamine - induced sensory memory impairment and improved attention , particularly in individuals prone to HD .",scaled attention,(KI) low intravenous dose of ketamine (0.04 mg/kg) || (NG) 4 mg dose of nicotine gum || hit rate in high - hallucinations/delusions (H-HD),"[(351, 363)]",3,dev,scaled attention
262,2645358_0,2645358,"TITLE : Reciprocal effects among changes in weight , body image , and other psychological factors during behavioral obesity treatment : a mediation analysis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Changes in body image and subjective well - being variables ( e.g. self - esteem ) are often reported as outcomes of obesity treatment . However , they may , in turn , also influence behavioral adherence and success in weight loss . The present study examined associations among obesity treatment - related variables , i.e. , change in weight , quality of life , body image , and subjective well - being , exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes , during a behavioral obesity treatment . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants ( BMI = 31.1 ± 4.1 kg / m2 ; age = 38.4 ± 6.7 y ) were 144 women who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program and a comparison group ( n = 49 ) , who received a general health education program . The intervention included regular group meetings promoting lasting behavior changes in physical activity and dietary intake . Body image , quality of life , subjective well - being , and body weight were measured at baseline and treatment 's end . Mediation was tested by multiple regression and a resampling approach to measure indirect effects . Treatment group assignment was the independent variable while changes in weight and in psychosocial variables were analyzed alternatively as mediators and as dependent variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 12 months , the intervention group had greater weight loss ( -5.6 ± 6.8 % vs. -1.2 ± 4.6 % , p < .001 ) and larger decreases in body size dissatisfaction ( effect size of 1.08 vs. .41 , p < .001 ) than the comparison group . Significant improvements were observed in both groups for all other psychosocial variables ( effect sizes ranging from .31–.75 , p < .05 ) . Mediation analysis showed that changes in body image and body weight were concurrently mediators and outcomes of treatment , suggesting reciprocal influences . Weight loss partially mediated the effect of treatment on quality of life and on self - esteem but the reciprocal effect was not observed . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Changes in weight and body image may reciprocally affect each other during the course of behavioral obesity treatment . No evidence of reciprocal relationships was found for the other models under analysis ; however , weight changes partially explained the effects of treatment on quality of life and self - esteem . Weight and psychosocial changes co - occur during treatment and will probably influence each other dynamically , in ways not yet adequately understood .

A recent study speculated that anesthesia induction using propofol 2 mg / kg transiently reduced left ventricular ( LV ) contraction by analyzing tissue Doppler - derived imaging ( TDI ) during induction phase . The purpose of this study was to analyze and to compare the impacts of propofol- and thiopental - induction on LV function . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four female patients with normal LV function undergoing non - cardiac surgery were randomly administered intravenous bolus thiopental ( 5 mg / kg , Thiopental - group , n = 12 ) or propofol ( 2 mg / kg , Propofol - group , n = 12 ) for anesthesia - induction . TDI of septal mitral annular velocity during systole ( S ' ) , early diastole ( e ' ) and atrial contraction ( a ' ) were determined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 , 3 , and 5 minutes after thiopental / propofol administration ( T0 , T1 , T2 , and T3 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The bispectral index and systolic blood pressure declined significantly during anesthesia induction in both groups , however , more depressed in Thiopental - group compared with those in Propofol - group at T2 and T3 ( all , p < 0.05 ) . Among TDI two parameters demonstrated a significant inter - group difference : the S ' in propofol was lower than that in Thiopental - group at T3 ( p = 0.002 ) , and a ' velocities were persistently lower in Propofol - group , compared with same time values in Thiopental - group ( T1 , T2 , and T3 : p = 0.025 , 0.007 , and 0.009 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Anesthesia induction using propofol revealed a more persistent and profound decline of LV and atrial contraction than that using thiopental .

This 12-week , double - blind study compared the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 ( mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post - dose ) at Week 12 ( primary endpoint ) and after Day 1 , and the percentage of COPD days with poor control ( i.e. , worsening symptoms ) . Safety was assessed by adverse events ( AEs ) , mean serum potassium and blood glucose , QTc ( Fridericia ) , and vital signs . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients were randomised ( n = 416 , mean age 63 years ) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d . ( n = 211 ) or placebo ( n = 205 ) via a single - dose dry - powder inhaler ; 87.5 % completed the study . Trough FEV1 ( LSM ± SEM ) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo , a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL ( p < 0.001 ) . Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) . Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo , both on Day 1 and at Week 12 , with indacaterol - placebo differences ( LSM ± SEM ) of 190 ± 28 ( p < 0.001 ) and 160 ± 28 mL ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 ( between 5 min and 4 h , 5 min and 1 h , and 1 and 4 h post - dose ) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) , with LSM ( ± SEM ) differences of 170 ± 24 , 180 ± 24 , and 170 ± 24 mL , respectively . Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5 % ( p < 0.001 ) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication ( p < 0.001 ) . The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups ( indacaterol 49.3 % , placebo 46.8 % ) , with the most common AEs being COPD worsening ( indacaterol 8.5 % , placebo 12.2 % ) and cough ( indacaterol 6.2 % , placebo 7.3 % ) . One patient died in the placebo group . Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups , and no patient had QTc > 500 ms .

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar .

450,5331772_4,5331772,"TITLE : The effect of a 10-week high - intensity interval training and ginger consumption on inflammatory indices contributing to atherosclerosis in overweight women ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Most of the cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by doing regular physical exercises and using herbal supplements . The present study is aimed at assessing ginger supplement and high - intensity interval training ( HIIT ) on inflammatory indices contributing to atherosclerosis in overweight women . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The present study is a randomized , experimental , and controlled one in which thirty healthy overweight women aged 20–30 years were randomly divided into three equal groups , namely , ginger , ginger + HIIT , and placebo + HIIT . The training groups performed high - intensity interval exercises ( i.e. 40-m maximal shuttle run ) for ten consecutive weeks . The supplement groups daily took 3 g of ginger pills and the third group took placebo . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Paired t - test revealed a significant decrease in the density of type 1 monocytes chemo tactic protein ( MCP-1 ) in HIIT + ginger ( P = 0.026 ) and HIIT + placebo ( P = 0.001 ) groups . Besides , maximum aerobic capacity in the two training groups significantly increased P = 0.002 and P = 0.000 , respectively . In spite of this , analysis of variance showed no significant differences in three groups regarding the three indices such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) ( P = 0.093 ) , MCP-1(P = 0.075 ) , and serum interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) ( P = 0.164 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : A 10-week intensive interval exercise , by itself or together with ginger supplement , improved MCP-1 and maximum oxygen consumption in overweight women , without any significant effect on soluble ICAM-1 and IL-10 . These findings indicate the relative and efficient role of HIIT in overweight women without the necessity to combine with ginger as an antioxidant / anti - inflammatory supplement .",scaled attention,High-intensity interval training (HIIT) plus either ginger or placebo || Ginger alone || Serum interleukin-10 (IL-10),"[(229, 274)]",3,dev,scaled attention
287,3557008_0,3557008,"TITLE : Can the infusion of isotonic fluids or vasopressors prevent hemodynamic changes in cardiac surgery patients ? ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : A common problem in cardiac surgery patients is decreased central venous pressure ( CVP ) and systemic blood pressure during transfer from operation room to intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Since these reductions may lead to dangerous complications , this study aimed to evaluate the effects of vasopressors and isotonic fluids on hemodynamic status of cardiac surgery patients during their transfer to ICU . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This randomized single - blind clinical trial was conducted in Chamran Hospital ( Isfahan , Iran ) . A total number of 75 consecutive patients undergoing planned first - time coronary artery bypass grafting entered our study . Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , CVP , and pulse rate ( PR ) were recorded at 5 to 10 minutes before leaving operating room and immediately after hospitalization in the ICU . Subjects in the first group received 7 cc / kg intravenous normal saline ( as an isotonic fluid ) within 5 - 10 minutes . The second group received 10 mg ephedrine before being transferred to the ICU . ABSTRACT . RESULTS : The mean age of participants was 61.0 ± 3.6 years . No significant change in PR was detected in normal saline group ( P > 0.05 ) . No significant differences were found in two groups in SBP before and after hospitalization in the ICU ( P > 0.05 ) . DBP and CVP had statistically significant reductions in both groups after hospitalization in the ICU ( P < 0.001 ) . The mean CVP was also reduced significantly ( 10.7 ± 2.9 vs. 8.2 ± 3.4 ; P < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Significant reductions in mean values of DBP and CVP occur during cardiac surgery and after arrival to the ICU . These reductions can not be prevented by administration of vasopressors , such as ephedrine , or infusion of isotonic fluids , such as normal saline . Further studies are required to assess whether more fluids , other types of fluids , or other drugs can stop this phenomenon .",lime,Ephedrine || Control (nothing) || Systolic blood preasure,"[(238, 260)]",5,dev,lime
392,5916905_2,5916905,"TITLE : High orange juice consumption with or in - between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects ABSTRACT : Sugar - containing beverages like orange juice can be a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes although the underlying mechanisms are less clear . We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in - between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk . Twenty - six healthy adults ( 24.7 ± 3.2 y ; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg / m2 ) participated in a 4-week cross - over intervention and consumed orange juice ( 20 % of energy requirement ) either together with 3 meals / d ( WM ) or in - between 3 meals / d ( BM ) at ad libitum energy intake . Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity ( primary outcome ) , daylong glycaemia , glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed . Body fat mass was measured by air - displacement plethysmography . After BM - intervention , fat mass increased ( +1.0 ± 1.8 kg ; p < 0.05 ) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease ( ΔMatsudaISI : −0.89 ± 2.3 ; p = 0.06 ) . By contrast , after WM - intervention fat mass and gamma - glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) decreased ( −0.30 ± 0.65 kg ; −2.50 ± 3.94 ; both p < 0.05 ) , whereas glucose variability was higher ( ΔMAGE : +0.45 ± 0.59 , p < 0.05 ) . Daylong glycaemia , insulin secretion , changes in basal insulin sensitivity , and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM - interventions ( all p > 0.05 ) . In young healthy adults , a conventional 3-meal structure with orange juice consumed together with meals had a favorable impact on energy balance , whereas juice consumption in - between meals may contribute to a gain in body fat and adverse metabolic effects .",scaled attention,Orange juice intake in-between meals (BM) || Orange juice intake with each meal (WM) || Basal insulin sensitivity,"[(258, 288)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : The Prospective , Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory ( PROSPER ) study was a multinational , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group Phase 3 study . The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly ( 28-day ) seizure frequency for the 16-week double - blind treatment period in the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population with analyzable seizure data . Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50 % seizure reduction , proportion of patients seizure free , and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Median percent reduction was -28.7 % for placebo , −38.2 % ( P = 0.08 vs placebo ) for once - daily SPN-804 1200 mg , and −42.9 % ( P = 0.003 ) for SPN-804 2400 mg . Responder rates were 28.1 % , 36.1 % ( P = 0.08 ) , and 40.7 % ( P = 0.02 ) ; 16-week seizure - free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3 % , 4.9 % ( P = 0.59 ) , and 11.4 % ( P = 0.008 ) , respectively . When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters , a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction ( placebo : −13.3 % ; 1200 mg : −34.5 % , P = 0.02 ; 2400 mg : −52.7 % , P = 0.006 ) in the North American study site cluster . A concentration – response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg . Adverse event types reflected the drug 's established profile . Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate - release OXC . Once - daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Adjunctive once - daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial - onset seizures .

294,3897026_4,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

376,2363753_2,2363753,"TITLE : A randomized trial of amifostine in patients with high - dose VIC chemotherapy plus autologous blood stem cell transplanation ABSTRACT : This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high - dose chemotherapy ( HD - VIC ) plus autologous bone marrow transplant ( HDCT ) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol - derivate amifostine . Additionally , the in - patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared . 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD - VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine ( 910 mg / m2 at day 1–3 ) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide . Patients were stratified according to pretreatment . HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin ( 500 mg / m2 / d over 18 h ) , ifosfamide ( 4 g / m2 / d over 4 h ) and etoposide ( 500 mg / m2 / d ) all given for 3 consecutive days . All patients received prophylactic application of G - CSF ( 5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously ) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment . Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity , gastrointestinal side effects , haematopoietic recovery , as well as frequency of fever and infections . The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was 10 % from baseline in the amifostine group ( 105 to 95 ml min−1 ) and 37 % in the control patient group ( 107 to 67 ml min−1 ) ( P < 0.01 ) . Amifostine - treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion . Stomatitis grade III / IV occurred in 25 % without versus 0 % of patients with amifostine ( P = 0.01 ) . Acute nausea / vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists / dexamethasone / trifluorpromazine . However , delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients . Engraftment of neutrophil ( > 500 μl−1 ) and thrombocytes ( > 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12 , respectively , both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm . In addition , a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm . The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30 % savings in costs for supportive care ( Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient ) . Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine , calculation of in - patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm . This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD - VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine . Additionally , a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine - treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned .

The aim of this study was to compare patients ' preference for olanzapine orodispersible tablet ( ODT ) with oral conventional tablet ( OCT ) . Methods . A 12-week randomized , crossover , multinational , open - label study was conducted to estimate the proportion of patients preferring ODT or OCT . Outpatients with stable schizophrenia on OCT monotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to ODT or OCT . Compliance and drug attitude were measured using the Drug Attitude Inventory ( DAI-10 ) and Medication Adherence Form ( MAF ) scales ; tolerability and safety by Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry ( AMDP-5 ) questionnaire and adverse event summary . Results . A total of 175 patients answered a preference question : 106 ( 61 % ) preferred ODT and 48 ( 27 % ) preferred OCT ( P<0.001 adjusted for treatment sequence ) ; 21 ( 12 % ) expressed no preference . There was no significant change in DAI-10 with either formulation . MAF was above 75 % in 94 % vs. 93 % of patients on ODC and OCT , respectively . Compliance as measured by tablet count was above 98 % on both formulations . The adverse event profiles did not differ between formulations . Mean weight increase over 6 weeks on ODT was 0.8 kg and on OCT was 0.6 kg . Conclusions . Given the importance of patients ' preference for treatment planning and success , the ODT formulation should be routinely considered as a treatment option .",scaled attention,Olanzapine orodispersible tablet || Olanzapine conventional tablet || Compliance,"[(95, 118)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",scaled attention,Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 || Placebo || Body fat mass,"[(319, 335)]",3,dev,scaled attention
382,4450462_2,4450462,"TITLE : A dietary intervention for chronic diabetic neuropathy pain : a randomized controlled pilot study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Diabetic neuropathy is a common and often debilitating condition for which available treatments are limited . Because a low - fat plant - based diet has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes , we hypothesized that such a diet would reduce painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : In this 20-week pilot study , individuals with type 2 diabetes and painful diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to two groups . The intervention group was asked to follow a low - fat , plant - based diet , with weekly classes for support in following the prescribed diet , and to take a vitamin B12 supplement . The control group was asked to take the same vitamin B12 supplement , but received no other intervention . At baseline , midpoint and 20 weeks , clinical , laboratory and questionnaire data were collected . Questionnaires included an analog ' worst pain ' scale , Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument , global impression scale , Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire , Neuropathy Total Symptom Score , a weekly pain diary and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : After 20 weeks , body weight change with the intervention was −6.4 kg ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) −9.4 to −3.4 , P<0.001 ) in an effect size analysis . Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot improved by an average of 12.4 microseimens ( 95 % CI 1.2–23.6 , P=0.03 ) with the intervention in an effect size analysis . The between - group difference in change in pain , as measured by the McGill pain questionnaire , was −8.2 points ( 95 % CI −16.1 to −0.3 , P=0.04 ) . Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire score change was −1.6 points ( 95 % CI −3.0 to −0.2 , P=0.03 ) .

This pilot study suggests the potential value of a plant - based diet intervention , including weekly support classes , for treating painful diabetic neuropathy .",deeplift,Prescribed diet plus vitamin B12 supplement || Only vitamin B12 supplement || Improvement in pain score,"[(276, 308)]",2,dev,deeplift
513,3916855_2,3916855,"TITLE : Effects of Vitamin A Supplementation on Iron Status Indices and Iron Deficiency Anaemia : A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : Iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world including developed and developing countries . Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",ig,vitamin A group || placebo group || serum ferritin level,"[(208, 256)]",0,dev,ig

This 12-week , double - blind study compared the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 ( mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post - dose ) at Week 12 ( primary endpoint ) and after Day 1 , and the percentage of COPD days with poor control ( i.e. , worsening symptoms ) . Safety was assessed by adverse events ( AEs ) , mean serum potassium and blood glucose , QTc ( Fridericia ) , and vital signs . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients were randomised ( n = 416 , mean age 63 years ) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d . ( n = 211 ) or placebo ( n = 205 ) via a single - dose dry - powder inhaler ; 87.5 % completed the study . Trough FEV1 ( LSM ± SEM ) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo , a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL ( p < 0.001 ) . Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) . Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo , both on Day 1 and at Week 12 , with indacaterol - placebo differences ( LSM ± SEM ) of 190 ± 28 ( p < 0.001 ) and 160 ± 28 mL ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 ( between 5 min and 4 h , 5 min and 1 h , and 1 and 4 h post - dose ) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) , with LSM ( ± SEM ) differences of 170 ± 24 , 180 ± 24 , and 170 ± 24 mL , respectively . Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5 % ( p < 0.001 ) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication ( p < 0.001 ) . The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups ( indacaterol 49.3 % , placebo 46.8 % ) , with the most common AEs being COPD worsening ( indacaterol 8.5 % , placebo 12.2 % ) and cough ( indacaterol 6.2 % , placebo 7.3 % ) . One patient died in the placebo group . Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups , and no patient had QTc > 500 ms .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) . There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion / extension ( p = 0.269 ) , varus / valgus ( p = 0.653 ) or rotational alignment ( p = 0.485 ) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment ( p = 0.778 ) or posterior slope ( p = 0.164 ) of the tibial component . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS - TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed , however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss .

However , there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection . We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile , oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption . A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) . Compared with group C , the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher ( P<0.001 and P<0.01 , respectively ) ; however , the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant ( P>0.05 ) . Additionally , no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups ( all P>0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B ( serum IL-10 : P<0.05 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<0.01 ) ; the serum E - selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C ( P>0.05 ) . Furthermore , the serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C ( serum IL-10 : P<0.001 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) ; however , the serum TNF - α levels did not differ among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C , there were no significant differences among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . In conclusion , we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion . Moreover , chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect , but there was no association between H. pylori infection , chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance .",ig,Alcohol consumption + H. pylori || Control || IL-10,"[(309, 327)]",0,dev,ig

Consultations were audiotaped and content analysed . Anxiety was assessed again immediately following the consultation . Within the next 10 days patients completed questionnaires assessing information needs , anxiety and satisfaction and were given a structured telephone interview assessing information recall . Patients provided with a question prompt sheet asked more questions about prognosis compared with controls and oncologists gave significantly more prognostic information to these patients . Provision of the question prompt sheet prolonged consultations and increased patient anxiety ; however , when oncologists specifically addressed the prompt sheet , anxiety levels were significantly reduced , consultation duration was decreased and recall was significantly improved .

159,3687261_0,3687261,"TITLE : Effects of a ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Macronutrient "" preloads "" can reduce postprandial glycemia by slowing gastric emptying and stimulating glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion . An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) .

263,2645358_1,2645358,"TITLE : Reciprocal effects among changes in weight , body image , and other psychological factors during behavioral obesity treatment : a mediation analysis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Changes in body image and subjective well - being variables ( e.g. self - esteem ) are often reported as outcomes of obesity treatment . However , they may , in turn , also influence behavioral adherence and success in weight loss . The present study examined associations among obesity treatment - related variables , i.e. , change in weight , quality of life , body image , and subjective well - being , exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes , during a behavioral obesity treatment . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants ( BMI = 31.1 ± 4.1 kg / m2 ; age = 38.4 ± 6.7 y ) were 144 women who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program and a comparison group ( n = 49 ) , who received a general health education program . The intervention included regular group meetings promoting lasting behavior changes in physical activity and dietary intake . Body image , quality of life , subjective well - being , and body weight were measured at baseline and treatment 's end . Mediation was tested by multiple regression and a resampling approach to measure indirect effects . Treatment group assignment was the independent variable while changes in weight and in psychosocial variables were analyzed alternatively as mediators and as dependent variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 12 months , the intervention group had greater weight loss ( -5.6 ± 6.8 % vs. -1.2 ± 4.6 % , p < .001 ) and larger decreases in body size dissatisfaction ( effect size of 1.08 vs. .41 , p < .001 ) than the comparison group . Significant improvements were observed in both groups for all other psychosocial variables ( effect sizes ranging from .31–.75 , p < .05 ) . Mediation analysis showed that changes in body image and body weight were concurrently mediators and outcomes of treatment , suggesting reciprocal influences . Weight loss partially mediated the effect of treatment on quality of life and on self - esteem but the reciprocal effect was not observed . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Changes in weight and body image may reciprocally affect each other during the course of behavioral obesity treatment . No evidence of reciprocal relationships was found for the other models under analysis ; however , weight changes partially explained the effects of treatment on quality of life and self - esteem . Weight and psychosocial changes co - occur during treatment and will probably influence each other dynamically , in ways not yet adequately understood .

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",ig,vitamin A group || placebo group || haemoglobin,"[(208, 256)]",0,dev,ig

135,4526979_1,4526979,"TITLE : The Web - Based Osteoarthritis Management Resource My Joint Pain Improves Quality of Care : A Quasi - Experimental Study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Despite the availability of evidence - based guidelines for conservative treatment of osteoarthritis ( OA ) , management is often confined to the use of analgesics and waiting for eventual total joint replacement . This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web - based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored , evidence - based information and tools aimed to improve self - management of OA on self - management and change in knowledge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A quasi - experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period . The intervention provided participants with general and user - specific information , monthly assessments with validated instruments , and progress - tracking tools . A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self - assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires ( users : n=104 ; nonusers : n=91 ) . The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire ( heiQ ) to evaluate 8 different domains ( health - directed activity , positive and active engagement in life , emotional distress , self - monitoring and insight , constructive attitudes and approaches , skill and technique acquisition , social integration and support , health service navigation ) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator ( OAQI ) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants . Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi - square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender ( 152/195 , 77.9 % female ) , age ( mean 60 , SD 9 years ) and body mass index ( mean 31.1 , SD 6.8 kg / m2 ) . With the exception of health service navigation , mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers , although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance . Within - group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self - management ( absolute change score=15 % , P=.03 ) , lifestyle ( absolute change score=16 % , P=.02 ) , and physical activity ( absolute change score=11 % , P=.04 ) , with no significant improvements for the nonusers . Following 12 months of exposure to the website , there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self - management ( absolute change score 15 % vs 2 % , P=.001 ) and weight reduction ( absolute change scores 3 % vs – 6 % , P=.03 ) measured on the OAQI . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ , but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA . Further work is required to improve engagement with the website and the quality of information delivered in order to provide a greater impact .",scaled attention,Website users || Nonusers || Domains examined for the heiQ,"[(364, 405)]",3,dev,scaled attention

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in - between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk . Twenty - six healthy adults ( 24.7 ± 3.2 y ; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg / m2 ) participated in a 4-week cross - over intervention and consumed orange juice ( 20 % of energy requirement ) either together with 3 meals / d ( WM ) or in - between 3 meals / d ( BM ) at ad libitum energy intake . Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity ( primary outcome ) , daylong glycaemia , glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed . Body fat mass was measured by air - displacement plethysmography . After BM - intervention , fat mass increased ( +1.0 ± 1.8 kg ; p < 0.05 ) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease ( ΔMatsudaISI : −0.89 ± 2.3 ; p = 0.06 ) . By contrast , after WM - intervention fat mass and gamma - glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) decreased ( −0.30 ± 0.65 kg ; −2.50 ± 3.94 ; both p < 0.05 ) , whereas glucose variability was higher ( ΔMAGE : +0.45 ± 0.59 , p < 0.05 ) .

169,3681374_0,3681374,"TITLE : Effects of mechanical insufflation - exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Weaning protocols that include noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) decrease re - intubation rates and ICU length of stay . However , impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure . Mechanical insufflation - exsufflation ( MI - E ) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV . We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI - E as part of an extubation protocol . ABSTRACT.METHOD : Patients with mechanical ventilation ( MV ) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria , who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial ( SBT ) , were randomly allocated before extubation , either for ( A ) a conventional extubation protocol ( control group ) , or ( B ) the MI - E extubation protocol ( study group ) . During the postextubation period ( 48 hours ) , group A patients received standard medical treatment ( SMT ) , including NIV in case of specific indications , whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in - exsufflation ( MI - E ) . Reintubation rates , ICU length of stay , and NIV failure rates were analyzed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Seventy - five patients ( 26 women ) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group ( n = 40 ; mean SAPS II , 47.8 ± 17.7 ) and to a study group ( n = 35 ; mean SAPS II , 45.0 ± 15.0 ) . MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group , respectively . In the 48 hours after extubation , 20 control patients ( 50 % ) and 14 study patients ( 40 % ) used NIV . Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls ; six patients ( 17 % ) versus 19 patients ( 48 % ) , P < 0.05 ; respectively , and a significantly lower time under MV ; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days ; P < 0.05 ; respectively . Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV , the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ; two patients ( 6 % ) versus 13 ( 33 % ) ; P < 0.05 , respectively . Mean ICU length of stay after extubation was significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ( 3.1 ± 2.5 versus 9.8 ± 6.7 days ; P < 0.05 ) . No differences were found in the total ICU length of stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Inclusion of MI - E may reduce reintubation rates with consequent reduction in postextubation ICU length of stay . This technique seems to be efficient in improving the efficacy of NIV in this patient population .",scaled attention,(B) the Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) extubation protocol (study group) || (A) a conventional extubation protocol (control group) || the reintubation rates related to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) failure,"[(392, 410)]",3,dev,scaled attention

This study was planned with an aim to study and compare the conventional clinical end point or BIS on the requirement of dosage of propofol , hemodynamic effects , and BIS alterations following propofol induction . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : 70 patients , ASA I and II , 20 - 60 years undergoing elective surgical procedure under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were selected and divided into two groups . Group A received ( inj . ) fentanyl ( 2 μg / kg ) , followed 3 min later by inj . propofol at the rate of 30 mg / kg / hr infusion till the loss of response to verbal command while group B received inj . fentanyl ( 2 μg / kg ) , followed 3 min later by inj . propofol at the rate of 30 mg / kg / hr infusion . The end point of hypnosis was when the BIS value was sustained for 1 min at 48±2 . The patients were intubated . Total induction dose of propofol was noted in each group . The value of BIS and hemodynamic parameters ( heart rate , systolic / diastolic blood pressure ) were noted at the time of loss of consciousness , at the time of intubation , and 1 min after intubation , thereafter every minute for first 10 min and thereafter every 10 min till end of surgery . Any involuntary muscle activity such as jerky movements , dystonic posturing , and opisthotonos were also recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The mean dose of propofol used in groups A and B were 1.85±0.48 mg / kg and 1.79±0.41 mg / kg , respectively . The dosage used in group B were less but not clinically significant ( P=0.575 ) . On comparing the dosage of propofol in males among the groups there was a significantly lower dosage of propofol required in group B ( 2.06±0.45 mg / kg and 1.83±0.32 mg / kg , respectively , P=0.016 ) . This decrease however was not seen in female patients dosage being 1.65±0.44 mg / kg and 1.75±0.49 mg / kg , respectively ( P=0.372 ) . The hemodynamic variables including heart rate , systolic / diastolic blood pressure and BIS were comparable within the group at induction , post - induction , and intubation . However , there was a significant increase in all the parameters at postintubation readings ( P<0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : No significant difference in the induction dose of propofol was observed when assessed clinically ( loss of verbal response ) or by BIS monitoring . Traditional teaching to titrate the dose of propofol and depth of anesthesia during intubation by loss of verbal response is as good as BIS value monitoring .",attention,propofol induction guided by BIS || propofol induction guided by clinical signs || mean dose of propofol required for induction,"[(458, 483)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : : A 3-mm transumbilical laparoscope with secondary midline port sites midway and suprapubically was used to perform a partial salpingectomy in 109 women desiring permanent sterilization . Each patient was randomly assigned to undergo a tubal resection either after Pomeroy ligation ( n=54 ) or after bipolar coagulation with Kleppinger forceps ( n=55 ) . Postoperative pain , as assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale , was the primary comparison endpoint . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : No technical difficulties with either technique required conversion to a minilaparotomy . The mean time to remove both tubal segments was not different between techniques ( 7 minutes , 21 seconds ; range , 4 minutes , 25 seconds to 15 minutes , 43 seconds ) . Each segment ( mean , 1.6 cm ; range , 0.8 to 3.5 cm ) was confirmed in the operating room , then histologically .

543,3460347_2,3460347,"TITLE : Nicotine , Auditory Sensory Memory , and ABSTRACT : Background : The procognitive actions of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) agonist nicotine are believed , in part , to motivate the excessive cigarette smoking in schizophrenia , a disorder associated with deficits in multiple cognitive domains , including low - level auditory sensory processes and higher - order attention - dependent operations . Objectives : As N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) hypofunction has been shown to contribute to these cognitive impairments , the primary aims of this healthy volunteer study were to : ( a ) to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of nAChR and NMDAR systems in the modulation of auditory sensory memory ( and sustained attention ) , as indexed by the auditory event - related brain potential – mismatch negativity ( MMN ) , and ( b ) to examine how these effects are moderated by a predisposition to auditory hallucinations / delusions ( HD ) . Methods : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled design involving a low intravenous dose of ketamine ( 0.04 mg / kg ) and a 4 mg dose of nicotine gum , MMN , and performance on a rapid visual information processing ( RVIP ) task of sustained attention were examined in 24 healthy controls psychometrically stratified as being lower ( L - HD , n = 12 ) or higher ( H - HD ) for HD propensity . Results : Ketamine significantly slowed MMN , and reduced MMN in H - HD , with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co - administration of nicotine . Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [ reaction time ( RT ) ] and accuracy ( increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms ) on the RVIP , with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine . Both % hits and d′ , as well as RT were poorer in H - HD ( vs. L - HD ) and while hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H - HD , RT was slowed by ketamine in L - HD .

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) .

ABSTRACT : Aripiprazole is a new anti psychotic with a unique receptor binding profile that combines partial agonistic activity at D2 receptor and 5-HT 1A receptor and potent antagonism at 5-HT 2A receptor . This receptor profile makes it possible for it to act as a dopamine system stabilizer . Based on various short term and long term studies , aripiprazole has been found to be effective in schizophrenia and has no significant adverse effect on QTc prolongation , prolactin , serum lipids , and has a low potential for weight gain . Present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole ( 10 - 15mg / day ) in the treatment of Indian patients of schizophrenia and to see its effect on QTc interval , prolactin levels , serum lipids , plasma sugar and weight gain in these patients . Outpatients with an ongoing / newly diagnosed ICD-10 Schizophrenia ( n=136 ) were randomly assigned to 10 or 15 mg dose of Aripiprazole for a period of six weeks . Clinical response was evaluated by the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale and safety was evaluated by observing spontaneously reported adverse events and changes in various laboratory parameters . Switching schizophrenic patients to aripiprazole ( 10/15 mg ) from both conventional and atypical anti - psychotics was safe and well tolerated . Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole , patients showed improvements in PANSS scores ( P < 0.001 ) , EPS , prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels . No difference was seen in the 10 or 15 mg dose groups . One hospitalization was reported ( due to hepatitis E ) . Common side effects reported were insomnia , somnolence , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea . Aripiprazole is a safe and effective anti psychotic in Indian patients - both in newly diagnosed , as well as , in patients not responding to or intolerant to other available typical and atypical antipsychotics .",scaled attention,aripiprazole (10-15mg/day) || baseline || Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS),"[(272, 291)]",3,dev,scaled attention

As a consequence , this might lead to a higher intake of energy - dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables , a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases . The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children . We used a randomized between - subject design with 127 children ( age : 7–12 y ) who played a memory - game , containing either fruit ( n = 64 ) or non - food products ( n = 63 ) . While playing the memory - game in a separate room in school during school hours , free intake of fruit ( mandarins , apples , bananas , and grapes ) was measured . Afterwards , the children completed self - report measures , and length and weight were assessed . The main finding is that playing a memory - game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake ( P = 0.016 ) . Children who played the fruit version of the memory - game ate more bananas ( P = 0.015 ) and mandarins ( P = 0.036 ) than children who played the non - food memory - game ; no effects were found for apples ( P > 0.05 ) and grapes ( P > 0.05 ) . The findings suggest that playing a memory - game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children . This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit , according to international standards , and more traditional health interventions have limited success . Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults , making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way .

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH , delivered as an extract of un - ripened avocado , on energy expenditure ( EE ) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs ( total of 12 dogs , 26.99 ± 0.634 kg , 4.9 ± 0.2 y ) . The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",scaled attention,Mannoheptulose || Control || Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation,"[(243, 258)]",3,dev,scaled attention
510,3938677_0,3938677,"TITLE : The Effects of Smoking on Levels of Endothelial Progenitor Cells and Microparticles in the Blood of Healthy Volunteers ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Cigarette smoking , both active and passive , is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular disease . To assess the impact of brief smoking on the vasculature , we determined levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) and circulating microparticles ( MPs ) following the smoking of one cigarette by young , healthy intermittent smokers . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : 12 healthy volunteers were randomized to either smoking or not smoking in a crossover fashion . Blood sampling was performed at baseline , 1 , 4 and 24 hours following smoking / not smoking . The numbers of EPCs and MPs were determined by flow cytometry . MPs were measured from platelets , leukocytes and endothelial cells . Moreover , MPs were also labelled with anti - HMGB1 and SYTO 13 to assess the content of nuclear molecules . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Active smoking of one cigarette caused an immediate and significant increase in the numbers of circulating EPCs and MPs of platelet- , endothelial- and leukocyte origin . Levels of MPs containing nuclear molecules were increased , of which the majority were positive for CD41 and CD45 ( platelet- and leukocyte origin ) . CD144 ( VE - cadherin ) or HMGB1 release did not significantly change during active smoking . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Brief active smoking of one cigarette generated an acute release of EPC and MPs , of which the latter contained nuclear matter . Together , these results demonstrate acute effects of cigarette smoke on endothelial , platelet and leukocyte function as well as injury to the vascular wall .",scaled attention,Smoking group || Control || Lactadherin+ CD144+,"[(223, 239)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : 191 chemotherapy - naïve patients were randomized to receive TOMOX or FOLFOX4 . Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Overall response rate was the primary endpoint . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 183 patients were included in the intent - to - treat analysis ( 92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4 ) . Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % ( p = 0.003 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival ( 15.6 and 17.2 months ; p = 0.475 ) ; progression - free survival ( 7.7 and 8.7 months ; p = 0.292 ) , and response duration ( 6.4 and 7.6 months ; p = 0.372 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia ( p < 0.0001 ) and leukopenia ( p = 0.028 ) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen , while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group ( p = ns ) . There were two treatment - related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm . Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks , and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks ; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first - line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity . The convenient TOMOX regimen may offer an alternative to fluoropyrimidine - based regimens .",gradients,TOMOX || FOLFOX4 || Hepatic disorders and asthenia,"[(224, 239)]",4,dev,gradients

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : The study consisted of two groups . Group 1 ( experimental group ) consisted of 20 ( 40 ears ) individuals exposed to occupational noise with hearing thresholds within 25 dB HL . They were further divided into three subgroups based on duration of noise exposure ( 0–5 years of exposure - T1 , 5–10 years of exposure - T2 , and > 10 years of exposure - T3 ) . Group 2 ( control group ) consisted of 20 individuals ( 40 ears ) . Absolute latency and amplitude of waves I , III , and V were compared between the two groups for both click and CE - chirp stimuli . T1 , T2 , and T3 groups were compared for the same parameters to see the effect of noise exposure duration on CE - chirp and click ABR . ABSTRACT.RESULT : : In Click ABR , while both the parameters for wave III were significantly poorer for the experimental group , wave V showed a significant decline in terms of amplitude only . There was no significant difference obtained for any of the parameters for wave I. In CE - Chirp ABR , the latencies for all three waves were significantly prolonged in the experimental group . However , there was a significant decrease in terms of amplitude in only wave V for the same group . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : : Compared to click evoked ABR , CE - Chirp ABR was found to be more sensitive in comparison of latency parameters in individuals with occupational noise exposure . Monitoring of early pathological changes at the brainstem level can be studied effectively by using CE - Chirp stimulus in comparison to click stimulus . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : This study indicates that ABR 's obtained with CE - chirp stimuli serves as an effective tool to identify the early pathological changes due to occupational noise exposure when compared to click evoked ABR .",deeplift,CE-chirp ABR || click ABR || wave I,"[(232, 246)]",2,dev,deeplift
220,5346637_5,5346637,"TITLE : A randomized phase II trial comparing chemoimmunotherapy with or without bevacizumab in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ABSTRACT : Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) with in vitro pro - apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects on chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells . As monotherapy in patients with CLL , it has no clinical activity . Here we report the results of an open - label , randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin , cyclophosphamide and rituximab ( PCR ) either without or with bevacizumab ( PCR - B ) in previously untreated CLL patients . A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled , 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR - B. A higher rate of grade 3 - 4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR - B ( 33 % vs. 3 % , p < 0.003 ) . Patients treated with PCR - B had a trend for a higher complete remission ( CR ) rate ( 54.5 % vs 31.3 % ; p = 0.08 ) , longer progression - free survival ( PFS)(p = 0.06 ) and treatment - free survival ( TFS)(p = 0.09 ) . No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab . A significant post - treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR - B arm ( 29.77 to 57.05 pg / mL ) ; in the PCR - B arm , lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR ( p = 0.01 ) . In conclusion , the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well - tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS .",ig,chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (PCR-B) || chemoimmunotherapy without bevacizumab (PCR) || PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status,"[(206, 223)]",0,dev,ig
491,2717426_6,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Acute , exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill . These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : In an open - label randomized trial , HIV - infected patients were randomized to switch from zidovudine / lamivudine ( AZT/3TC ) to abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) or tenofovir / emtricitabine ( TDF / FTC ) . We measured bone mass density ( BMD ) and bone turnover biomarkers ( osteocalcin , osteocalcin , procollagen type 1 N - terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) , alkaline phosphatase , type I collagen cross - linked C - telopeptide ( CTx ) , and osteoprotegerin ) . We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance , plasma cystatin C , and urinary levels of creatinine , albumin , cystatin C , and neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of 40 included patients , 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up . BMD was measured in 33 , 26 , and 27 patients at baseline , week 24 , and week 48 , respectively . In TDF / FTC - treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 ( −1.8 % and −2.5 % ) and week 48 ( −2.1 % and −2.1 % ) , whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm . The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms . All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF / FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm , but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD . Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF - treated patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Switching to TDF / FTC - based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC - based treatment .

Ten experienced , college - aged men performed four protocols ( one per week ) : no - exercise seated control ( CTRL ) , virtual drumming on a handheld gaming device ( HANDHELD ) , active drumming on drum pads ( DRUM ) , and walking on a treadmill at ~30 % of VO2max ( WALK ) . Protocols were performed after an overnight fast , and expired air was collected continuously during ( 30min ) and after ( 30min ) exercise . DRUM and HANDHELD song lists , day of the week , and time of day were identical for each participant . Significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) among the average rates of energy expenditure ( kcal·min−1 ) during activity included WALK > DRUM > HANDHELD . No significant differences in the rates of energy expenditure among groups during recovery were observed . Total energy expenditure was significantly greater ( p < 0.05 ) during WALK ( 149.5 ± 30.6 kcal ) compared to DRUM ( 118.7 ± 18.8 kcal ) and HANDHELD ( 44.9±11.6 kcal ) , and greater during DRUM compared to HANDHELD . Total energy expenditure was not significantly different between HANDHELD ( 44.9 ± 11.6 kcal ) and CTRL ( 38.2 ± 6.0 kcal ) . Active video game drumming at expert - level significantly increased energy expenditure compared to handheld , but it hardly met moderate - intensity activity standards , and energy expenditure was greatest during walking . Energy expenditure with handheld video game drumming was not different from no - exercise control . Thus , traditional aerobic exercise remains at the forefront for achieving the minimum amount and intensity of physical activity for health , individuals desiring to use video games for achieving weekly physical activity recommendations should choose games that require significant involvement of lower - body musculature , and time spent playing sedentary games should be a limited part of an active lifestyle .",scaled attention,Drumming on drum pads || Virtual drumming || Total energy expenditure,"[(188, 231)]",3,dev,scaled attention

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) .

The proportion of affected patients , the optimum follow - up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , phase IV , controlled , crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control . With the exception of withdrawals , each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each , with a 1-week wash - out period between treatments . Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples . We used the Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups . Comparisons were also made using independent two - sample t - tests and Welch 's t - test . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed when necessary . We used either a Mann – Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly ( 0.3 mmol / L and 0.24 mmol / L respectively ) . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol / L did not differ between treatments : 37 % for olmesartan and 40 % for enalapril . The mean e - GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study . The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar ( 23 % in olmesartan and 29 % in enalapril patients ) in the 4 weeks time point . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia , even after a two month period , did not differ between treatments . There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups . The follow - up of these patients should include control of potassium levels , at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment .

This 12-week , double - blind study compared the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 ( mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post - dose ) at Week 12 ( primary endpoint ) and after Day 1 , and the percentage of COPD days with poor control ( i.e. , worsening symptoms ) . Safety was assessed by adverse events ( AEs ) , mean serum potassium and blood glucose , QTc ( Fridericia ) , and vital signs . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients were randomised ( n = 416 , mean age 63 years ) to receive either indacaterol 150 μg o.d . ( n = 211 ) or placebo ( n = 205 ) via a single - dose dry - powder inhaler ; 87.5 % completed the study . Trough FEV1 ( LSM ± SEM ) at Week 12 was 1.48 ± 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 ± 0.019 L for placebo , a clinically relevant difference of 130 ± 24 mL ( p < 0.001 ) . Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) . Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo , both on Day 1 and at Week 12 , with indacaterol - placebo differences ( LSM ± SEM ) of 190 ± 28 ( p < 0.001 ) and 160 ± 28 mL ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 ( between 5 min and 4 h , 5 min and 1 h , and 1 and 4 h post - dose ) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo ( p < 0.001 ) , with LSM ( ± SEM ) differences of 170 ± 24 , 180 ± 24 , and 170 ± 24 mL , respectively . Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5 % ( p < 0.001 ) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication ( p < 0.001 ) . The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups ( indacaterol 49.3 % , placebo 46.8 % ) , with the most common AEs being COPD worsening ( indacaterol 8.5 % , placebo 12.2 % ) and cough ( indacaterol 6.2 % , placebo 7.3 % ) . One patient died in the placebo group . Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups , and no patient had QTc > 500 ms .

The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",scaled attention,Mannoheptulose || Control || Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation,"[(243, 258)]",3,dev,scaled attention

We evaluated the efficacy of a multistrain probiotic compound , alone and in combination with lactulose , in the treatment of MHE . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : This study has two parts . First , consecutive adult patients with MHE were randomized to receive lactulose ( 30–60 mL / day ) + probiotic ( 200 million colony forming units of seven bacteria species / day ) ( Gp - LPr ) or lactulose + placebo ( Gp - L ) . In second part , a non - randomized group of patients received probiotic alone ( Gp - Pr ) . Medication duration was for 2 weeks and patients were followed - up for another 8 weeks . Improvement in MHE status was assessed by psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score ( PHES ) . Development of overt encephalopathy , hospitalization , and death were considered as secondary outcomes . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Sixty patients ( 80 % male , mean age 38.4 ± 9.6 years ) completed the intervention . PHES significantly improved after medication in all the three groups ( Gp - LPr : −3.8 ± 3.9 to −1.6 ± 3.0 ; Gp - L : −4.8 ± 4.1 to −1.6 ± 2.9 ; and Gp - Pr : −4.9 ± 3.7 to −2.1 ± 2.5 , P < 0.001 ) . After 8 weeks follow - up , improvement was maintained in Gp - LPr and Gp - Pr , but there was deterioration in those who did not receive probiotics ( Gp - L : PHES score reversed to −4.8 ± 4.2 ) . Two patients ( one each in Gp - L and Gp - Pr ) experienced overt encephalopathy . One patient was hospitalized due to worsening of ascites ( Gp - LPr ) and one due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( Gp - L ) . Side effects were mild and not significantly different among the groups .

Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period . We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats ( > 200 gr , > 6 week ) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model . Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin ( OC ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period . The results were analyzed and compared between groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups , their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group . The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension ( 60.14 ± 11.73 ng / mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng / mL ; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU / mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng / mL ; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium . This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation , may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis . Thus calcitriol supplementation could be an available , economic and effective strategy for preventing bone metabolic changes related to weightlessness commonly encountered in space flight . The outcome of this study needs to be further studied in future trying to find more definite results .",scaled attention,Calcitriol + Hind-limb suspension || Control || Alkaline phosphatase,"[(169, 205)]",3,dev,scaled attention

A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) . Compared with group C , the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher ( P<0.001 and P<0.01 , respectively ) ; however , the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant ( P>0.05 ) . Additionally , no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups ( all P>0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B ( serum IL-10 : P<0.05 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<0.01 ) ; the serum E - selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C ( P>0.05 ) . Furthermore , the serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C ( serum IL-10 : P<0.001 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) ; however , the serum TNF - α levels did not differ among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C , there were no significant differences among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . In conclusion , we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion . Moreover , chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect , but there was no association between H. pylori infection , chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance .",attention,Alcohol consumption + H. pylori || Alcohol consumption || E-selectin,"[(277, 309)]",1,dev,attention
26,4608185_1,4608185,"TITLE : Training in ChiRunning to reduce blood pressure : a randomized controlled pilot study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : People with prehypertension ( 120–130/80–90 mmHg ) are at increased risk of progressing to hypertension . Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity . We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time . ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial .

Methods . A randomized , double - blind , double - dummy , active - controlled , two - period crossover study in adult patients receiving around - the - clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge . Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient . The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 ( moderate withdrawal ) or use of rescue medication . Results . 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal . One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50 % full μ - opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity . The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar , and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine . There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments . The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache ( 19 % ) , vomiting ( 13 % ) , nausea , diarrhea , and drug withdrawal syndrome ( each 9 % ) , and with full μ - opioid agonist were headache ( 16 % ) , drug withdrawal syndrome ( 13 % ) , and nausea ( 6 % ) . Conclusions . Chronic pain patients treated with around - the - clock full μ - opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine ( a partial μ - opioid agonist ) at approximately 50 % of the full μ - opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control .",scaled attention,Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP) || Full μ-opioid agonist* || pain ratings,"[(220, 231)]",3,dev,scaled attention

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin , alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation , on lipid profile , antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients . ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS : A double - blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients ( n = 76 ) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc ( 30 mg / d ) and selenium ( 150 μg / d ) supplementation . The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention : anthropometric measurements , lipid profile , high sensitivity C - reactive protein ( hs - CRP ) , electronegative low density lipoprotein ( LDL(- ) ) concentrations , activities of glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes . Significance was determined using an α of 5 % ( two - tailed ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol , LDL - cholesterol , non - HDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and hs - CRP independently of mineral supplementation . Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(- ) . Similarly , the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments . Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients . The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin . Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients .

It has been shown that the subclinical inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes . In the present study , we determined the effects of metformin on the levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( i.e. , IL-6 , TNF - α , and MCP-1 ) and anti - inflammatory mediator IL-10 in blood and urine of patients with type 2 diabetes . There were 210 patients with type 2 diabetes , which were randomized into metformin ( n = 112 ) and non - metformin ( gliclazide , acarbose , and repaglinide , n = 98 ) groups . The levels of cytokines were measured by the ELISA . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We found that metformin reduced the levels of IL-6 in blood and MCP-1 in urine , but increased IL-10 levels in blood of patients with type 2 diabetes . There were no significant differences of TNF - α between metformin and non - metformin groups . Furthermore , compared to individual drug treatment , metformin significantly reduced the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF - α , as well as urine MCP-1 . When the patients were stratified based on the durations and doses of metformin , we found that there was only change ( i.e. , increase ) in serum IL-10 levels in patients with metformin for more than 1 year compared to treatment for less than 1 year . Metformin ( 1.5 g ) treatment reduced the urinary levels of MCP-1 as compared with dose of 1.0 g in patients with type 2 diabetes .

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms , and levels of proinflammatory cytokines , brain - derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers , would predict or impact treatment response . ABSTRACT.METHOD : : Seventy - nine participants ( 10 dropouts ) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self - report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation ( containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum ) or a matched placebo , in a double - blind trial for 8 weeks .

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood , or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers . The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity , chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample ; recruiting an antidepressant - naive sample experiencing mild , acute symptoms of low mood , may well yield a different result . Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective . Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area .

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity .

However , it is still unknown which type of exercise affects cognition . In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that a demanding balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition . Forty healthy participants aged 19–65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention . Each group exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks . Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance , cardiorespiratory fitness , memory , spatial cognition , and executive functions . Only the balance group significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest , while cardiorespiratory fitness remained unchanged in both groups . Moreover , the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition . Effects on executive functions were not observed . These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition . Therefore , an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition . It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways between the vestibular system and these brain regions .",attention,demanding balance training program || relaxation group || memory score,"[(152, 168)]",1,dev,attention

Given that immigrant parents and children are at greater risk for becoming overweight / obese with increased time in the US , identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Baseline data was collected on 383 mother - child dyads enrolled in Live Well , a community - based , participatory , randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers . Socio - demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and child . Acculturation , behavioral data , and responses to the Caregiver 's Feeding Styles Questionnaire ( CFSQ ) were also obtained from the mother . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The children 's average age was 6.2 ± 2.7 years , 58 % male . Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 ± 3.3 years , and are Brazilian ( 36 % ) , Haitian ( 34 % ) and Latino ( 30 % ) . Seventy - two percent of the mothers were overweight / obese , while 43 % of the children were overweight / obese . Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding style as being high demanding / high responsive ; 32 % as being high demanding / low responsive ; 34 % as being low demanding / high responsive and 18 % as being low demanding / low responsive . In bivariate analyses , feeding styles significantly differed by child BMIz - score , ethnic group , and mother 's perceived stress . In multiple linear regression , a low demanding / high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated ( ß = 0.56 ) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding / high responsive , controlling for known covariates ( p = 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Most mothers report having a low demanding / high responsive feeding style , which is associated with higher child weight status in this diverse immigrant population . This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding style may be a risk factor for childhood obesity . Further research is needed to help understand the larger socio - cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes . How parents establish a certain feeding style in their home country compared to when they move to the US "" obesogenic "" environment , should also be explored .",ig,low demanding/high responsive feeding style || high demanding/high responsive feeding style || child weight,"[(306, 354)]",0,dev,ig

This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014–2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran . Data were collected using standard questionnaires , including the Elder Abuse - Knowledge Questionnaire , Health - Promoting Behavior Questionnaire , Health - Promoting Lifestyle Profile II , Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle , Perceived Social Support , Perceived Self - Efficacy , Loneliness Scale , Geriatric Depression Scale , Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale , and the SCARED ( stress , coping , argument , resources , events , and dependence ) tool . The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months . Data analysis were performed using χ2 tests , multiple linear and logistic regression , and structural equation modeling ( SEM ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse , self - efficacy , social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups . However , the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse ( 94.8 % in the intervention group and 46.6 % in the control group ) , high self - efficacy ( 82.8 % and 7.8 % , respectively ) , high social support ( 97.0 % and 10.3 % , respectively ) and high health promoting lifestyle ( 97.0 % and 10.3 % , respectively ) was significantly higher ( P<0.001 ) and the frequency of elder abuse risk ( 28.0 % and 49.6 % , respectively ) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention .

This post hoc analysis of three randomized trials evaluated whether disease duration affected responses to pramlintide . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Patients received mealtime pramlintide 30 or 60 μg ( n = 714 ) or placebo ( n = 537 ) as an adjunct to insulin and were stratified into tertiles by diabetes duration at baseline . Efficacy and safety end points were assessed at week 26 using analysis of covariance and logistic regression models . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Disease durations for tertiles 1 , 2 , and 3 were 6.7 , 16.5 , and 29.9 years , respectively . In all tertiles , pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and weight than placebo , with greater weight reductions and insulin sparing in tertiles 2 and 3 . Insulin dose and weight increased in the placebo group in all tertiles . Baseline HbA1c was a predictor of HbA1c lowering in both treatment groups ( P < 0.0001 ) ; higher daily insulin predicted a smaller percent increase in insulin dose for placebo ( P = 0.01 ) ; and higher body weight predicted greater weight loss in both pramlintide- and placebo - treated patients ( P < 0.05 ) . Event rates for severe hypoglycemia were similar for pramlintide and placebo and increased with longer duration of diabetes for both groups . Nausea with pramlintide increased with longer disease duration . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Mealtime pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c than placebo , regardless of diabetes duration at baseline . Longer disease duration appeared to augment insulin sparing and weight loss with pramlintide , with a potential for increased incidence of hypoglycemia and nausea .

452,4758401_1,4758401,"TITLE : Fixed ratio dosing of pramlintide with regular insulin before a standard meal in patients with type 1 diabetes ABSTRACT : Amylin is co‐secreted with insulin and is therefore lacking in patients with type 1 diabetes . Replacement with fixed ratio co‐administration of insulin and the amylin analogue pramlintide may be superior to separate dosing . This concept was evaluated in a ratio‐finding study . Patients with type 1 diabetes were enrolled in a randomized , single‐masked , standard breakfast crossover study using regular human insulin injected simultaneously with pramlintide 6 , 9 or 12 mcg / unit insulin or placebo . Insulin dosage was reduced by 30 % from patients ' usual estimates . Plasma glucose , glucagon and pramlintide and adverse events were assessed . All ratios reduced 0–3‐h glucose and glucagon increments by > 50 % . No hypoglycaemia occurred . Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild . All pramlintide / insulin ratios markedly and safely reduced glycaemic excursions and suppressed glucagon secretion in the immediate postprandial state . Further study using one of these ratios to explore the efficacy and safety of longer‐term meal‐time and basal hormone replacement is warranted .",scaled attention,Insulin + Pramlintide (all doses) || Insulin alone || Hypoglycemia after 24 hours,"[(141, 145)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Among 189 adults [ 73 males , 116 females ; age = 41 to 74 years ; mean body mass index ( BMI ) = 27.3 kg / m2 ] , assessments of % BF at the baseline and six months from the baseline were conducted by performing BIA and DXA . Bland - Altman analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between % BFBIA and % BFDXA . Compared with DXA , BIA underestimated % BF [ in males : 4.6 , – 2.4 to 11.7 ( mean biases , 95 % limit of agreement ) at the baseline , 1.4 , – 7.4 to 10.2 at the endpoint , and 3.2 , – 4.8 to 11.3 in changes ; in females : 5.1 , – 2.4 to 12.7 ; 2.2 , – 6.1 to 10.4 ; and 3.0 , – 4.8 to 10.7 , respectively ] . For males and females , % BFDXA proved to be a significant predictor of the difference between DXA and BIA at the baseline , the endpoint , and in changes when BMI and age were considered ( in males : p<0.01 and R 2 = 23.1 % , 24.1 % , 20.7 % , respectively ; for females : p<0.001 and R 2 = 40.4 % , 48.8 % , 25.4 % , respectively ) .

The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",ig,Mannoheptulose || Control || Body weight,"[(243, 258)]",0,dev,ig

This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) .

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity .

The primary outcome was change in sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density to the end of treatment cycle 1 ( day 28 ) , analysed by modified intention to treat ( mITT ) . Key secondary outcomes included safety and time to first pulmonary exacerbation — after reaching the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint subjects discontinued study drug although remained in the study . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : DRCFI resulted in a mean ( SD ) 4.2 ( 3.7 ) log10 CFU / g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 ( vs −0.08 ( 3.8 ) with placebo , p=0.002 ) . DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation ( median 134 vs 58 days , p=0.057 mITT , p=0.046 per protocol ) . DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group , but fewer pulmonary adverse events . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Once - daily inhaled DRCFI demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non - CF bronchiectasis and ciprofloxacin - sensitive P aeruginosa . In this modest - sized phase II study , DRCFI was also well tolerated and delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation in the per protocol population .",attention,Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (DRCFI) || Placebo || CFU/g reduction in bacterial density of Pseudomona aeruginosa,"[(209, 246)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) . There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion / extension ( p = 0.269 ) , varus / valgus ( p = 0.653 ) or rotational alignment ( p = 0.485 ) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment ( p = 0.778 ) or posterior slope ( p = 0.164 ) of the tibial component . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS - TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed , however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss . MIS - TKA in combination with computer navigation is safe in terms of implant positioning .

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH , delivered as an extract of un - ripened avocado , on energy expenditure ( EE ) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs ( total of 12 dogs , 26.99 ± 0.634 kg , 4.9 ± 0.2 y ) . The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",lime,Mannoheptulose || Control || Post-prandial respiratory quotient,"[(258, 287)]",5,dev,lime

ABSTRACT.DESIGN : Quasi - randomized controlled trial . ABSTRACT.SETTING : A total of 34 randomly selected general practices from a German region ( participation rate 87 % ) . ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS : A total of 1499 consecutive patients aged 18–70 years with daily cigarette smoking ( participation rate 80 % ) . ABSTRACT.INTERVENTIONS : The tailored letters intervention group received up to three individualized personal letters . Brief advice was delivered during routine consultation by the practitioner after an onsite training session . Both interventions were based on the Transtheoretical Model of behaviour change . ABSTRACT.MEASUREMENTS : Self - reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence at 6- , 12- , 18- and 24-month follow - ups . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : Among participants completing the last follow - up , 6-month prolonged abstinence was 18.3 % in the tailored letters intervention group , 14.8 % in the brief advice intervention group and 10.5 % in the assessment - only control group . Assuming those lost to follow - up to be smokers , the rates were 10.2 % , 9.7 % and 6.7 % , respectively . Analyses including all follow - ups confirmed statistically significant effects of both interventions compared to assessment only . Using complete case analysis , the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.4 ; P = 0.047 ] but not for 7-day point prevalence abstinence ( OR = 1.4 ; P = 0.068 ) for prolonged abstinence , or for alternative assumptions about participants lost to follow - up . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The study demonstrated long - term efficacy of low - cost interventions for smoking cessation in general practice . The interventions are suitable to reach entire populations of general practices and smoking patients .

The present studies aimed to demonstrate the added benefit and optimal dosages of the combination product over individual ingredients alone in improving sleep and pain . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Each of the two studies was a two - centre , randomised , double - blind and double - dummy trial . In the first study , subjects were randomised into one of the following treatment arms : NS 440 mg / DPH 50 mg , NS 220 mg / DPH 50 mg , NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg . In the second study , subjects received either NS 440 mg / DPH 25 mg , NS 440 mg or DPH 50 mg . The co - primary end - points in both studies were wake time after sleep onset ( WASO ) and sleep latency ( SL ) measured by actigraphy . Other secondary sleep and pain end - points were also assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The intent - to - treat population included 712 and 267 subjects from studies one and two , respectively . In the first study , only the NS 440 mg / DPH 50 mg combination showed significant improvements in both WASO vs. NS alone ( −70.3 min p = 0.0002 ) and SL vs. DPH alone ( 25.50 and 41.50 min respectively , p < 0.0001 ) . In the second study , the NS 440 mg / DPH 25 mg combination failed to show any significant improvements vs. either component alone .

An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In type 2 diabetes , acute administration of a d - xylose preload reduces postprandial glycemia and enhances the effect of a DPP-4 inhibitor .",lime,sitagliptin and d-xylose || placebo and sucralose || overall blood glucose,"[(177, 231)]",5,dev,lime

188,2966708_6,2966708,"TITLE : Comparison of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses after laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Laparoscopic surgery is associated with a more favorable clinical outcome than that of conventional open surgery . This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) .

293,3897026_3,3897026,"TITLE : Preemptive low - dose of ketamine does not effective on anesthetic consumption , perioperative analgesic requirement and postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting in painful ophthalmic surgery ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Ketamine , a non - competitive NMDA ( N - Methyl - D - Aspartate ) receptor antagonist , is recognized as an intraoperative anesthetic agent . Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) .

348,3750227_0,3750227,"TITLE : Risk of hyperkalemia in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease initiating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers : a randomized study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are renoprotective but both may increase serum potassium concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The proportion of affected patients , the optimum follow - up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , phase IV , controlled , crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control . With the exception of withdrawals , each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each , with a 1-week wash - out period between treatments . Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples . We used the Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups . Comparisons were also made using independent two - sample t - tests and Welch 's t - test . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed when necessary . We used either a Mann – Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly ( 0.3 mmol / L and 0.24 mmol / L respectively ) . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol / L did not differ between treatments : 37 % for olmesartan and 40 % for enalapril . The mean e - GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study . The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar ( 23 % in olmesartan and 29 % in enalapril patients ) in the 4 weeks time point . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia , even after a two month period , did not differ between treatments . There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups . The follow - up of these patients should include control of potassium levels , at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment .

After 6 months , there was a significant reduction in systolic ( P < 0.001 ) and diastolic BP ( P = 0.010 ) in the intervention group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Participatory method of education could help us to convince patients to have better self - care to control disease . Furthermore , since adherence to the treatment of hypertensive patients in our society is low , organizing such courses can teach essential knowledge and skills to lifestyle change and prevention of complications . Performing these courses is recommended for other chronic disease patients in health - care centers to assess self - management programs on self - care behavior .",attention,"6 weekly sessions including exercises, weight control, medication adherence, and home self-monitoring || routine care from health-care center || average of physical activity","[(258, 292)]",1,dev,attention
180,5584005_7,5584005,"TITLE : Evaluation of a guided continuous quality improvement program in community pharmacies ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : The importance of creating and sustaining a strong culture of patient safety has been recognized as a critical component of safe medication use . This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Guided CQI program implementation increased the self - reported patient safety culture attitudes among staff .

Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",lime,Litesse® Ultra polydextrose  ́+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 || Placebo || Energy intake,"[(478, 491)]",5,dev,lime

This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) .

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in - between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk . Twenty - six healthy adults ( 24.7 ± 3.2 y ; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg / m2 ) participated in a 4-week cross - over intervention and consumed orange juice ( 20 % of energy requirement ) either together with 3 meals / d ( WM ) or in - between 3 meals / d ( BM ) at ad libitum energy intake .

However , they may , in turn , also influence behavioral adherence and success in weight loss . The present study examined associations among obesity treatment - related variables , i.e. , change in weight , quality of life , body image , and subjective well - being , exploring their role as both mediators and outcomes , during a behavioral obesity treatment . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants ( BMI = 31.1 ± 4.1 kg / m2 ; age = 38.4 ± 6.7 y ) were 144 women who attended a 12-month obesity treatment program and a comparison group ( n = 49 ) , who received a general health education program . The intervention included regular group meetings promoting lasting behavior changes in physical activity and dietary intake . Body image , quality of life , subjective well - being , and body weight were measured at baseline and treatment 's end . Mediation was tested by multiple regression and a resampling approach to measure indirect effects . Treatment group assignment was the independent variable while changes in weight and in psychosocial variables were analyzed alternatively as mediators and as dependent variables . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 12 months , the intervention group had greater weight loss ( -5.6 ± 6.8 % vs. -1.2 ± 4.6 % , p < .001 ) and larger decreases in body size dissatisfaction ( effect size of 1.08 vs. .41 , p < .001 ) than the comparison group . Significant improvements were observed in both groups for all other psychosocial variables ( effect sizes ranging from .31–.75 , p < .05 ) . Mediation analysis showed that changes in body image and body weight were concurrently mediators and outcomes of treatment , suggesting reciprocal influences . Weight loss partially mediated the effect of treatment on quality of life and on self - esteem but the reciprocal effect was not observed . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Changes in weight and body image may reciprocally affect each other during the course of behavioral obesity treatment . No evidence of reciprocal relationships was found for the other models under analysis ; however , weight changes partially explained the effects of treatment on quality of life and self - esteem . Weight and psychosocial changes co - occur during treatment and will probably influence each other dynamically , in ways not yet adequately understood .

This suggests a gap in knowledge for persons with OA regarding the many different treatments available to them . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to evaluate outcomes after usage of a Web - based resource called My Joint Pain that contains tailored , evidence - based information and tools aimed to improve self - management of OA on self - management and change in knowledge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A quasi - experimental design was used to evaluate the My Joint Pain website intervention over a 12-month period . The intervention provided participants with general and user - specific information , monthly assessments with validated instruments , and progress - tracking tools . A nationwide convenience sample of 195 participants with self - assessed hip and/or knee OA completed both baseline and 12-month questionnaires ( users : n=104 ; nonusers : n=91 ) . The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire ( heiQ ) to evaluate 8 different domains ( health - directed activity , positive and active engagement in life , emotional distress , self - monitoring and insight , constructive attitudes and approaches , skill and technique acquisition , social integration and support , health service navigation ) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator ( OAQI ) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants . Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi - square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender ( 152/195 , 77.9 % female ) , age ( mean 60 , SD 9 years ) and body mass index ( mean 31.1 , SD 6.8 kg / m2 ) . With the exception of health service navigation , mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers , although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance . Within - group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self - management ( absolute change score=15 % , P=.03 ) , lifestyle ( absolute change score=16 % , P=.02 ) , and physical activity ( absolute change score=11 % , P=.04 ) , with no significant improvements for the nonusers . Following 12 months of exposure to the website , there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self - management ( absolute change score 15 % vs 2 % , P=.001 ) and weight reduction ( absolute change scores 3 % vs – 6 % , P=.03 ) measured on the OAQI . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ , but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA .

489,2717426_4,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) .

661,5086025_0,5086025,"TITLE : Teaching Intuitive Eating and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Skills Via a Web - Based Intervention : A Pilot Single - Arm Intervention Study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Middle - aged women are at risk of weight gain and associated comorbidities . Deliberate restriction of food intake ( dieting ) produces short - term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long - term weight management . Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating ( ie , eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals ) and the development of greater psychological flexibility ( ie , the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ ACT ] ) . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : This pilot study investigated the usage , acceptability , and feasibility of "" Mind , Body , Food , "" a Web - based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants were 40 overweight women ( mean age 44.8 [ standard deviation , SD , 3.06 ] years , mean body mass index [ BMI ] 32.9 [ SD 6.01 ] kg / m2 , mean Intuitive Eating Scale [ IES-1 ] total score 53.4 [ SD 7.46 ] , classified as below average ) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin , New Zealand . Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics . Use of an online self - monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database . Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention . BMI , intuitive eating , binge eating , psychological flexibility , and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 40 women enrolled in the study , 12 ( 30 % ) completed all 12 modules ( median 7.5 [ interquartile range , IQR , 2 - 12 ] modules ) and 4 ( 10 % ) used the self - monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period ( median 3 [ IQR 1 - 9 ] weeks ) . Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments , most women rated "" Mind , Body , Food "" as useful ( 20/26 , 77 % ) , easy to use ( 17/25 , 68 % ) and liked the intervention ( 22/25 , 88 % ) . From pre- to postintervention , there were statistically significant within - group increases in intuitive eating ( IES-2 total score P<.001 ; all IES-2 subscale scores : P ≤.01 ) , psychological flexibility ( P=.01 ) , and general mental health ( P<.001 ) as well as significant decreases in binge eating ( P=.01 ) . At the 3-month follow - up , IES-2 improvements were maintained , and there were further improvements in binge eating ( P<.001 ) and general mental health ( P=.03 ) , and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility ( P=.06 ) . There were no significant within - group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow - up ( P=.46 and P=.93 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The "" Mind , Body , Food "" prototype Web - based intervention is appealing to middle - aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills , reduce binge eating , and maintain weight over 3 months .

Objectives : As N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) hypofunction has been shown to contribute to these cognitive impairments , the primary aims of this healthy volunteer study were to : ( a ) to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of nAChR and NMDAR systems in the modulation of auditory sensory memory ( and sustained attention ) , as indexed by the auditory event - related brain potential – mismatch negativity ( MMN ) , and ( b ) to examine how these effects are moderated by a predisposition to auditory hallucinations / delusions ( HD ) . Methods : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled design involving a low intravenous dose of ketamine ( 0.04 mg / kg ) and a 4 mg dose of nicotine gum , MMN , and performance on a rapid visual information processing ( RVIP ) task of sustained attention were examined in 24 healthy controls psychometrically stratified as being lower ( L - HD , n = 12 ) or higher ( H - HD ) for HD propensity . Results : Ketamine significantly slowed MMN , and reduced MMN in H - HD , with amplitude attenuation being blocked by the co - administration of nicotine . Nicotine significantly enhanced response speed [ reaction time ( RT ) ] and accuracy ( increased % hits and d′ and reduced false alarms ) on the RVIP , with improved performance accuracy being prevented when nicotine was administered with ketamine . Both % hits and d′ , as well as RT were poorer in H - HD ( vs. L - HD ) and while hit rate and d′ was increased by nicotine in H - HD , RT was slowed by ketamine in L - HD .

This prospective , randomized , blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid ( hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution ( Hartmann 's Solution ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid ( N = 60 ) or crystalloid ( N = 60 ) intra - operatively . The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting . Patients were interviewed to assess nausea , vomiting , anti - emetic use , dizziness , sore throat , headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2 , 24 and 48 hours post operatively . Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea ( 38.2 % vs 17.9 % , P = 0.03 ) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively ( 1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2 , P = 0.028 ) . The incidence of vomiting and anti - emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups . Sore throat , dizziness , headache and general well being were not different between the groups . A comparable reduction on post - operative FVC and FEV-1 and PEFR was observed in both groups .

Additionally , the in - patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared . 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD - VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine ( 910 mg / m2 at day 1–3 ) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide . Patients were stratified according to pretreatment . HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin ( 500 mg / m2 / d over 18 h ) , ifosfamide ( 4 g / m2 / d over 4 h ) and etoposide ( 500 mg / m2 / d ) all given for 3 consecutive days . All patients received prophylactic application of G - CSF ( 5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously ) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment . Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity , gastrointestinal side effects , haematopoietic recovery , as well as frequency of fever and infections . The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was 10 % from baseline in the amifostine group ( 105 to 95 ml min−1 ) and 37 % in the control patient group ( 107 to 67 ml min−1 ) ( P < 0.01 ) . Amifostine - treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion . Stomatitis grade III / IV occurred in 25 % without versus 0 % of patients with amifostine ( P = 0.01 ) . Acute nausea / vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists / dexamethasone / trifluorpromazine . However , delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients . Engraftment of neutrophil ( > 500 μl−1 ) and thrombocytes ( > 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12 , respectively , both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm . In addition , a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm . The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30 % savings in costs for supportive care ( Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient ) . Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine , calculation of in - patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm . This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD - VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine . Additionally , a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine - treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned .

We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time . ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial .

300,5156604_1,5156604,"TITLE : Memorizing fruit : The effect of a fruit memory - game on children 's fruit intake ABSTRACT : Food cues of palatable food are omnipresent , thereby simulating the intake of unhealthy snack food among children . As a consequence , this might lead to a higher intake of energy - dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables , a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases . The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children . We used a randomized between - subject design with 127 children ( age : 7–12 y ) who played a memory - game , containing either fruit ( n = 64 ) or non - food products ( n = 63 ) . While playing the memory - game in a separate room in school during school hours , free intake of fruit ( mandarins , apples , bananas , and grapes ) was measured . Afterwards , the children completed self - report measures , and length and weight were assessed . The main finding is that playing a memory - game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake ( P = 0.016 ) . Children who played the fruit version of the memory - game ate more bananas ( P = 0.015 ) and mandarins ( P = 0.036 ) than children who played the non - food memory - game ; no effects were found for apples ( P > 0.05 ) and grapes ( P > 0.05 ) . The findings suggest that playing a memory - game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children . This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit , according to international standards , and more traditional health interventions have limited success . Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults , making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way .

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms , and levels of proinflammatory cytokines , brain - derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers , would predict or impact treatment response . ABSTRACT.METHOD : : Seventy - nine participants ( 10 dropouts ) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self - report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation ( containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum ) or a matched placebo , in a double - blind trial for 8 weeks . Data were analysed as intent - to - treat . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure ( Cohen 's d range = 0.07–0.16 ) or any blood - based biomarker . At end - point , 9 ( 23 % ) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60 % change on the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( responders ) , compared to 10 ( 26 % ) of those in the placebo group ( χ12=0.107 , p = ns ) . Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures . Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood , or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers . The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity , chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample ; recruiting an antidepressant - naive sample experiencing mild , acute symptoms of low mood , may well yield a different result . Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective . Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area .

Telemonitoring has been proposed as a solution to this growing problem , but its impact on patient outcome is equivocal . This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate effectiveness of telemonitoring in improving COPD patient outcome . In total , 106 subjects were randomly assigned to the telemonitoring ( n = 53 ) or usual care ( n = 53 ) group . During the two months following discharge , telemonitoring group patients had to report their symptoms daily using an electronic diary . The primary outcome measure was time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation within six months of discharge . During the follow - up period , time to first re - admission for COPD exacerbation was significantly increased in the telemonitoring group than in the usual care group ( p = 0.026 ) . Telemonitoring was also associated with a reduced number of all - cause re - admissions ( 0.23 vs. 0.68 / patient ; p = 0.002 ) and emergency room visits ( 0.36 vs. 0.91 / patient ; p = 0.006 ) . In conclusion , telemonitoring intervention was associated with improved outcomes among COPD patients admitted for exacerbation in a country characterized by a small territory and high accessibility to medical services .

Increasing interest in the use of low - dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia has developed in part because of its NMDA - antagonistic properties , which may be important in attenuating central sensitization and opioid tolerance . Despite of many trial evaluations which have been done on the effect of low - dose ketamine in postoperative pain , the role of ketamine , as a component of perioperative analgesia , remains unclear . We evaluated the analgesic effect of low - dose ketamine during anesthesia induction in painful ophthalmic surgery . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : After institutional approval and written informed consent , 88 patients undergoing retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery aged 18 - 80 years old were randomly divided intoequal case and control groups . Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental , fentanyl , atracurium , and liducaine , and maintained with N2O , O2 , and propofol . Ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was administered intravenously to patients in the case group during anesthetic induction . Mean blood pressure and pulse rate were listed in questionnaire every 5 minutes . The consumption of anesthetic , perioperative additional analgesic , extubation time , postoperative pain and nausea scores ( based on Visual Analog Scale ) , vomiting frequency , and the recovery time were recorded . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were no differences in the recovery time ( 17.3 ± 3.4 in the case group vs. 16.3 ± 3 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , postoperative pain scores ( 5 ± 1 in the case group vs. 5.6 ± 2 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the consumption of anesthetic ( 9376.9 ± 1245.8 in the case group vs. 9012.9 ± 1620 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , the analgesic requirements ( 1000 in the case group vs. 940.9 ± 135.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) , and perioperative additional analgesic ( 63.4 ± 26.5 in the case group vs. 69.4 ± 25.6 in the control group , P < 0.05 ) between two groups . The extubation time in the case group ( 13.59 ± 4.83 ) was significantly shorter than in the control group ( 15.9 ± 3.6 ) ( P = 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : This study demonstrates that a low dose administration of ketamine during anesthesia induction in retinal detachment , strabismus , and keratoplasty surgery improves the extubation time but have no effect on postoperative pain , nausea and vomiting , and perioperative additional analgesic requirements .",lime,Ketamine || Control || Time for extubation,"[(416, 447)]",5,dev,lime
45,4223282_0,4223282,"TITLE : The impact of SASA ! , a community mobilization intervention , on reported HIV - related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics in Kampala , Uganda ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) violates women 's human rights , and it is a serious public health concern associated with increased HIV risk . SASA ! , a phased community mobilization intervention , engages communities to prevent IPV and promote gender equity . The SASA ! study assessed the community - level impact of SASA ! on reported HIV - related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Data were collected as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2012 in eight communities in Kampala . An adjusted cluster - level intention to treat analysis , compares secondary outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow - up . The qualitative evaluation explored participants ' subjective experience of SASA ! . A total of 82 in - depth interviews were audio recorded at follow - up , transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Men in intervention communities were significantly more likely than controls to report a broad range of HIV - protective behaviours , including higher levels of condom use ( aRR 2.03 , 95 % CI 1.22–3.39 ) , HIV testing ( aRR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.13–2.00 ) and fewer concurrent partners ( aRR 0.60 , 95 % CI 0.37–0.97 ) . They were also more likely to report increased joint decision - making ( aRR 1.92 , 95 % CI 1.27–2.91 ) , greater male participation in household tasks ( aRR 1.48 , 95 % CI 1.09–2.01 ) , more open communication and greater appreciation of their partner 's work inside ( aRR 1.31 , 95 % CI 1.04–1.66 ) and outside ( aRR 1.49 , 95 % CI 1.08–2.06 ) the home . For women , all outcomes were in the hypothesized direction , but effect sizes were smaller . Only some achieved statistical significance . Women in intervention communities were significantly more likely to report being able to refuse sex with their partners ( aRR 1.16 , 95 % CI 1.00–1.35 ) , joint decision - making ( aRR 1.37 , 95 % CI 1.06–1.78 ) and more open communication on a number of indicators . Qualitative interviews suggest that shifts operated through broader improvements in relationships , including increased trust and cooperation , participants ' greater awareness of the connections between HIV and IPV and their resultant desire to improve their relationships . Barriers to change include partial uptake of SASA ! , partner resistance , fear and entrenched previous beliefs . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : SASA ! impacted positively on reported HIV - related risk behaviours and relationship dynamics at a community level , especially among men . Social change programmes focusing on IPV and gender equity could play an important role in HIV prevention efforts .",attention,SASA! community mobilization intervention program || no intervention || women's ability to refuse sex,"[(340, 369)]",1,dev,attention

Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages , it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : The effects of add - on prolonged - release melatonin ( PRM ) ( 2 mg ) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients ( men [ 50.7 % ] , women [ 49.3 % ] , average age 75.3 years [ range , 52–85 years ] ) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD , with and without insomnia comorbidity , and receiving standard therapy ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine ) . In this randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study , patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks , followed by 2 weeks placebo . The AD Assessment Scale – Cognition ( ADAS - Cog ) , Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( IADL ) , Mini – Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , sleep , as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) and a daily sleep diary , and safety parameters were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients treated with PRM ( 24 weeks ) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo , as measured by the IADL ( P=0.004 ) and MMSE ( P=0.044 ) . Mean ADAS - Cog did not differ between the groups . Sleep efficiency , as measured by the PSQI , component 4 , was also better with PRM ( P=0.017 ) . In the comorbid insomnia ( PSQI ≥6 ) subgroup , PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo , in mean IADL ( P=0.032 ) , MMSE score ( +1.5 versus −3 points ) ( P=0.0177 ) , and sleep efficiency ( P=0.04 ) . Median ADAS - Cog values ( −3.5 versus +3 points ) ( P=0.045 ) were significantly better with PRM . Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration . PRM was well tolerated , with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Add - on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo , particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity . The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline .",attention,Prolonged-release melatonin || Placebo || MMSE cognitive performance,"[(284, 316)]",1,dev,attention

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin , alone or associated with zinc and selenium supplementation , on lipid profile , antioxidant enzymes and mineral status in coronary artery disease patients . ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS : A double - blind randomized clinical trial was performed in which patients ( n = 76 ) were treated with 10 mg rosuvastatin over 4 months associated or not with zinc ( 30 mg / d ) and selenium ( 150 μg / d ) supplementation . The following parameters were analyzed before and after the intervention : anthropometric measurements , lipid profile , high sensitivity C - reactive protein ( hs - CRP ) , electronegative low density lipoprotein ( LDL(- ) ) concentrations , activities of glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , zinc and selenium concentrations in blood plasma and erythocytes . Significance was determined using an α of 5 % ( two - tailed ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We found that rosuvastatin therapy was efficient in reducing total cholesterol , LDL - cholesterol , non - HDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and hs - CRP independently of mineral supplementation . Neither treatment was associated with significant changes in LDL(- ) . Similarly , the antioxidant enzymes GPx and SOD activity were unchanged by treatments . Neither treatment was associated with significant differences in concentrations of zinc or selenium in blood plasma and erythocytes of studied groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Rosuvastatin treatment did not affect zinc and selenium levels in coronary artery disease patients . The zinc and selenium supplementation at doses used in this study did not change lipid profile or SOD and GPx activity in patients receiving rosuvastatin . Further studies should be focused on testing alternative doses and supplements in different populations to contribute for a consensus on the ideal choice of antioxidants to be used as possible complementary therapies in atherosclerotic patients .

An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) .

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",lime,vitamin A group || placebo group || serum iron,"[(208, 256)]",5,dev,lime

Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) . No significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) in insulin , cholesterol measurements ( total cholesterol , LDL - C , HDL - C , triglycerides and cholesterol ratios ) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed . All other measurements ( AST , ALT , ALP , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c ( p > 0.05 ) of type 2 diabetic patients . The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested . Therefore , the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients .",lime,Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) || Any other food || HbA1c levels,"[(355, 374)]",5,dev,lime

171,3681374_2,3681374,"TITLE : Effects of mechanical insufflation - exsufflation in preventing respiratory failure after extubation : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Weaning protocols that include noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) decrease re - intubation rates and ICU length of stay . However , impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure . Mechanical insufflation - exsufflation ( MI - E ) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV . We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI - E as part of an extubation protocol . ABSTRACT.METHOD : Patients with mechanical ventilation ( MV ) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria , who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial ( SBT ) , were randomly allocated before extubation , either for ( A ) a conventional extubation protocol ( control group ) , or ( B ) the MI - E extubation protocol ( study group ) . During the postextubation period ( 48 hours ) , group A patients received standard medical treatment ( SMT ) , including NIV in case of specific indications , whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in - exsufflation ( MI - E ) . Reintubation rates , ICU length of stay , and NIV failure rates were analyzed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Seventy - five patients ( 26 women ) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group ( n = 40 ; mean SAPS II , 47.8 ± 17.7 ) and to a study group ( n = 35 ; mean SAPS II , 45.0 ± 15.0 ) . MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group , respectively . In the 48 hours after extubation , 20 control patients ( 50 % ) and 14 study patients ( 40 % ) used NIV . Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls ; six patients ( 17 % ) versus 19 patients ( 48 % ) , P < 0.05 ; respectively , and a significantly lower time under MV ; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days ; P < 0.05 ; respectively . Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV , the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ; two patients ( 6 % ) versus 13 ( 33 % ) ; P < 0.05 , respectively . Mean ICU length of stay after extubation was significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ( 3.1 ± 2.5 versus 9.8 ± 6.7 days ; P < 0.05 ) . No differences were found in the total ICU length of stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Inclusion of MI - E may reduce reintubation rates with consequent reduction in postextubation ICU length of stay . This technique seems to be efficient in improving the efficacy of NIV in this patient population .",lime,(B) the MI-E extubation protocol (study group) || (A) a conventional extubation protocol (control group) || the reintubation rate,"[(326, 357)]",5,dev,lime

ABSTRACT : Aripiprazole is a new anti psychotic with a unique receptor binding profile that combines partial agonistic activity at D2 receptor and 5-HT 1A receptor and potent antagonism at 5-HT 2A receptor . This receptor profile makes it possible for it to act as a dopamine system stabilizer . Based on various short term and long term studies , aripiprazole has been found to be effective in schizophrenia and has no significant adverse effect on QTc prolongation , prolactin , serum lipids , and has a low potential for weight gain . Present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole ( 10 - 15mg / day ) in the treatment of Indian patients of schizophrenia and to see its effect on QTc interval , prolactin levels , serum lipids , plasma sugar and weight gain in these patients . Outpatients with an ongoing / newly diagnosed ICD-10 Schizophrenia ( n=136 ) were randomly assigned to 10 or 15 mg dose of Aripiprazole for a period of six weeks . Clinical response was evaluated by the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale and safety was evaluated by observing spontaneously reported adverse events and changes in various laboratory parameters . Switching schizophrenic patients to aripiprazole ( 10/15 mg ) from both conventional and atypical anti - psychotics was safe and well tolerated . Six weeks after switching to aripiprazole , patients showed improvements in PANSS scores ( P < 0.001 ) , EPS , prolactin levels and weight over the baseline levels . No difference was seen in the 10 or 15 mg dose groups . One hospitalization was reported ( due to hepatitis E ) . Common side effects reported were insomnia , somnolence , nausea , vomiting and diarrhea . Aripiprazole is a safe and effective anti psychotic in Indian patients - both in newly diagnosed , as well as , in patients not responding to or intolerant to other available typical and atypical antipsychotics .",scaled attention,"aripiprazole (10-15mg/day) || baseline || Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), prolactin levels and weight","[(291, 301)]",3,dev,scaled attention
666,4845428_0,4845428,"TITLE : Reducing surgical levels by paraspinal mapping and diffusion tensor imaging techniques in lumbar spinal stenosis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Correlating symptoms and physical examination findings with surgical levels based on common imaging results is not reliable . In patients who have no concordance between radiological and clinical symptoms , the surgical levels determined by conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and neurogenic examination ( NE ) may lead to a more extensive surgery and significant complications . We aimed to confirm that whether the use of diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) and paraspinal mapping ( PM ) techniques can further prevent the occurrence of false positives with conventional MRI , distinguish which are clinically relevant from levels of cauda equina and/or nerve root lesions based on MRI , and determine and reduce the decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE , while ensuring or improving surgical outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We compared the data between patients who underwent MRI + ( PM or DTI ) and patients who underwent conventional MRI + NE to determine levels of decompression for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis . Outcome measures were assessed at 2 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , and 12 months postoperatively . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : One hundred fourteen patients ( 59 in the control group , 54 in the experimental group ) underwent decompression . The levels of decompression determined by MRI + ( PM or DTI ) in the experimental group were significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group ( p = 0.000 ) . The surgical time , blood loss , and surgical transfusion were significantly less in the experimental group ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.011 , p = 0.001 , respectively ) . There were no differences in improvement of the visual analog scale back and leg pain ( VAS - BP , VAS - LP ) scores and Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) scores at 2 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , and 12 months after operation between the experimental and control groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : MRI + ( PM or DTI ) showed clear benefits in determining decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE . In patients with lumbar spinal stenosis , the use of PM and DTI techniques reduces decompression levels and increases safety and benefits of surgery .",scaled attention,MRI + (PM or DTI) || MRI + NE || levels of decompression,"[(232, 269)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 40 participants with type 1 diabetes , of whom 24 were adults [ mean ± standard deviation ( s.d . ) age 43 ± 12 years and glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 8.0 ± 0.9 % ] and 16 were adolescents ( mean ± s.d . age 15.6 ± 3.6 years and HbA1c 8.1 ± 0.8 % ) , underwent two periods of sensor‐augmented pump therapy in the home setting , in combination with or without an overnight closed‐loop insulin delivery system that uses a model predictive control algorithm to direct insulin delivery . The order of the two interventions was random ; each period lasted 4 weeks in adults and 3 weeks in adolescents . The primary outcome was time during which sensor glucose readings were in the target range of 3.9–8.0 mmol / l . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range ( 3.9–8.0 mmol / l ) overnight ( between 24:00 and 08:00 hours ) was 18.5 % greater during closed‐loop insulin delivery than during sensor‐augmented therapy ( p < 0.001 ) . Closed‐loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol / l ( p < 0.001 ) , with no difference in glycaemic variability , as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose . Time spent above the target range was reduced ( p = 0.001 ) , as was time spent in hypoglycaemia ( < 3.9 mmol / l ; p = 0.014 ) during closed‐loop therapy . Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed‐loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery ( p < 0.001 ) without changes to the total daily delivery ( p = 0.84 ) .

However , there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection . We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile , oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption . A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) . Compared with group C , the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher ( P<0.001 and P<0.01 , respectively ) ; however , the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant ( P>0.05 ) . Additionally , no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups ( all P>0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B ( serum IL-10 : P<0.05 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<0.01 ) ; the serum E - selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C ( P>0.05 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : In an open - label randomized trial , HIV - infected patients were randomized to switch from zidovudine / lamivudine ( AZT/3TC ) to abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) or tenofovir / emtricitabine ( TDF / FTC ) . We measured bone mass density ( BMD ) and bone turnover biomarkers ( osteocalcin , osteocalcin , procollagen type 1 N - terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) , alkaline phosphatase , type I collagen cross - linked C - telopeptide ( CTx ) , and osteoprotegerin ) . We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance , plasma cystatin C , and urinary levels of creatinine , albumin , cystatin C , and neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of 40 included patients , 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up . BMD was measured in 33 , 26 , and 27 patients at baseline , week 24 , and week 48 , respectively . In TDF / FTC - treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 ( −1.8 % and −2.5 % ) and week 48 ( −2.1 % and −2.1 % ) , whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm . The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms . All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF / FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm , but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD . Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF - treated patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Switching to TDF / FTC - based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC - based treatment .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : 20 participants were randomly allocated to an intervention ( n = 11 ) or control ( n = 9 ) group . The intervention group attended individual sessions with an experienced clinician once a week for 10 weeks and performed daily home exercises with adherence monitored by a self - report diary . The control group received no treatment . Blinded assessment was conducted at baseline and 11 weeks . Questionnaires assessed self - reported changes in back pain , physical function , and health - related quality of life . Objective measures of thoracic kyphosis , back and shoulder muscle endurance ( Timed Loaded Standing Test ) , and function ( Timed Up and Go test ) were also taken . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Compared with the control group , the intervention group showed significant reductions in pain during movement ( mean difference ( 95 % CI ) -1.8 ( -3.5 to -0.1 ) ) and at rest ( -2.0 ( -3.8 to -0.2 ) ) and significantly greater improvements in Qualeffo physical function ( -4.8 ( -9.2 to -0.5 ) ) and the Timed Loaded Standing test ( 46.7 ( 16.1 to 77.3 ) secs ) . For the perceived change in back pain over the 10 weeks , 9/11 ( 82 % ) participants in the intervention group rated their pain as ' much better ' compared with only 1/9 ( 11 % ) participants in the control group .

In a prospective , single - site , open - label , non - randomized , controlled , pilot trial , we evaluated a polyherbal formulation ( PHF ) for its safety and efficacy in treating subjects with HIV - AIDS . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : A total of 32 and 31 subjects were enrolled under the PHF and highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) arms , respectively , and followed up for a period of 24 months . Plasma viral RNA , CD4 cell count and blood chemistry were monitored at 3-month intervals . Following mid - term safety evaluation , 12 subjects from the PHF arm were shifted to HAART and were followed separately as PHF - to - HAART arm , for the rest of the period . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count ( 154.4 cells / μl / year , P<0.001 ) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months ( -0.431 + 0.004 log10 IU / month , P<0.001 ) . In contrast , the PHF arm showed a profile of CD4 cell loss at remarkably slower kinetics ( 14.3 cells / μl / year , P=0.021 ) and insignificant reduction in the viral load . The PHF and HAART arms did not differ significantly in the occurrence of AIDS - related illnesses over the study period of 24 months . In the PHF - to - HAART arm , the rates of CD4 count and reduction in viral load were significant and comparable to that of the HAART group . In the PHF arm , at 1 month , a significant increase in CD4 cell count and a concomitant decrease in viral load were seen . ABSTRACT.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS : : The PHF appears to have provided protection by delaying the kinetics of CD4 cell reduction . Given the several study limitations , drawing assertive inferences from the data is challenging . Future studies with a stringent study design are warranted to confirm these findings .",attention,Polyherbal formulation || No treatment || Viral load,"[(230, 265)]",1,dev,attention

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms , and levels of proinflammatory cytokines , brain - derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers , would predict or impact treatment response . ABSTRACT.METHOD : : Seventy - nine participants ( 10 dropouts ) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self - report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation ( containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum ) or a matched placebo , in a double - blind trial for 8 weeks . Data were analysed as intent - to - treat . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure ( Cohen 's d range = 0.07–0.16 ) or any blood - based biomarker . At end - point , 9 ( 23 % ) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60 % change on the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( responders ) , compared to 10 ( 26 % ) of those in the placebo group ( χ12=0.107 , p = ns ) . Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures . Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood , or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers . The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity , chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample ; recruiting an antidepressant - naive sample experiencing mild , acute symptoms of low mood , may well yield a different result . Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective . Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area . The results of this trial are preliminary ; future studies in the area should not be discouraged .",scaled attention,Probiotics || Placebo || Anxiety,"[(145, 169)]",3,dev,scaled attention

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in - between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk . Twenty - six healthy adults ( 24.7 ± 3.2 y ; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg / m2 ) participated in a 4-week cross - over intervention and consumed orange juice ( 20 % of energy requirement ) either together with 3 meals / d ( WM ) or in - between 3 meals / d ( BM ) at ad libitum energy intake . Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity ( primary outcome ) , daylong glycaemia , glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed . Body fat mass was measured by air - displacement plethysmography . After BM - intervention , fat mass increased ( +1.0 ± 1.8 kg ; p < 0.05 ) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease ( ΔMatsudaISI : −0.89 ± 2.3 ; p = 0.06 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study ( Controlled phase – initial therapy ) followed by an open - label follow - up ( Open phase – test medication initial and maintenance therapy ) . Included were postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy symptoms and Vaginal Maturation Index ( VMI ) of ≤ 40 % . The method of treatment was initial therapy with test medication ( or placebo in first phase ) , one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days , followed by maintenance therapy , one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : A total of 87 women completed the study . The Controlled phase results for a change in VMI demonstrated superiority of the 0.03 mg estriol – lactobacilli combination to placebo ( p < 0.001 ) . In the test group , the positive change in VMI was 35.2 % , compared to 9.9 % in the placebo group . In the Open phase after the initial therapy , the VMI was increased to 55.4 % and , during maintenance therapy , it stayed at a comparable level ( 52.8–49.4 % ) .

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : 191 chemotherapy - naïve patients were randomized to receive TOMOX or FOLFOX4 . Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Overall response rate was the primary endpoint . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 183 patients were included in the intent - to - treat analysis ( 92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4 ) . Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % ( p = 0.003 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival ( 15.6 and 17.2 months ; p = 0.475 ) ; progression - free survival ( 7.7 and 8.7 months ; p = 0.292 ) , and response duration ( 6.4 and 7.6 months ; p = 0.372 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia ( p < 0.0001 ) and leukopenia ( p = 0.028 ) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen , while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group ( p = ns ) . There were two treatment - related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm . Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks , and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks ; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first - line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity .

621,3620516_0,3620516,"TITLE : Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) of the visual cortex : a proof - of - concept study based on interictal electrophysiological abnormalities in migraine ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Preventive pharmacotherapy for migraine is not satisfactory because of the low efficacy / tolerability ratio of many available drugs . Novel and more efficient preventive strategies are therefore warranted . Abnormal excitability of cortical areas appears to play a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) is a non - invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex , and is being tested in various medical indications . The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting , possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen . We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex , especially the visual cortex , is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level . If one accepts this concept , anodal tDCS over the visual cortex may have therapeutic potentials in migraine prevention , as it is able to increase neuronal firing . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To study the effects of anodal tDCS on visual cortex activity in healthy volunteers ( HV ) and episodic migraine without aura patients ( MoA ) , and its potentials for migraine prevention . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We recorded pattern - reversal visual evoked potentials ( VEP ) before and after a 15-min session of anodal tDCS over the visual cortex in 11 HV and 13 MoA interictally . Then 10 MoA patients reporting at least 4 attacks / month subsequently participated in a therapeutic study , and received 2 similar sessions of tDCS per week for 8 weeks as migraine preventive therapy . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In HV as well as in MoA , anodal tDCS transiently increased habituation of the VEP N1P1 component . VEP amplitudes were not modified by tDCS . Preventive treatment with anodal tDCS turned out to be beneficial in MoA : migraine attack frequency , migraine days , attack duration and acute medication intake significantly decreased during the treatment period compared to pre - treatment baseline ( all p < 0.05 ) , and this benefit persisted on average 4.8 weeks after the end of tDCS . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Anodal tDCS over the visual cortex is thus able to increase habituation to repetitive visual stimuli in healthy volunteers and in episodic migraineurs , who on average lack habituation interictally . Moreover , 2 weekly sessions of anodal tDCS had a significant preventive anti- migraine effect , proofing the concept that the low preactivation level of the visual cortex in migraine patients can be corrected by an activating neurostimulation . The therapeutic results indicate that a larger sham - controlled trial using the same tDCS protocol is worthwhile .",scaled attention,Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) || baseline || acute medication intake,"[(344, 403)]",3,dev,scaled attention

155,4183082_0,4183082,"TITLE : Comparison of the Incidence of Sore Throat After Rapid Sequence Intubation With Succinylcholine and Cisatracurium ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : Postoperative sore throat is a common complication of endotracheal intubation and can lead to dissatisfaction after surgery . Airway management has the strongest influence on the incidence of sore throat and improving endotracheal intubating conditions can reduce this complaint . Type of induction agent used during anesthesia can contribute to variances in the degree of post - operative sore throat . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : : We aimed to compare the incidence of postoperative sore throat after rapid sequence induction with Succinylcholine and high dose Cisatracurium . ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS : : The study was carried out on patients admitted to Shohada - e - Tajrish hospital for emergent abdominal surgery . Of the 80 patients who were enrolled in the study , 40 were randomly assigned to receive Succinylcholine while the remaining patients received Cistracurium during induction . Sore throat , muscle ache , hoarseness , dry throat and pain were assessed in each patient at baseline in recovery and at 2 , 4 , 12 and 24 hours post - operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Number of patients who developed sore throat was significantly higher in the Succinylcholine group ( 75 % ) compared to Cisatracurium group ( 27.5 % ) at the time of entrance to the recovery room ( P = 0.001 ) . These numbers decreased at 2 hours post – operation ( 42 % versus 17.5 % ) but the difference was still statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) . At 12 ( P = 0.062 ) and 24 ( P = 0.14 ) hours post operation , the difference was no longer significant . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : Use of high dose Cisatracurium for induction during rapid sequence intubation carries a lower chance of developing sore throat compared to Succinylcholine .

A conclusion is yet to be reached on the role of crystalloids and colloids in immediate fluid therapy . This study was done to determine the suitable solution in immediate resuscitation of patients with hemorrhagic shock caused by tissue trauma . ABSTRACT.METHODS : One hundred trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock , who underwent fluid therapy in the emergency unit , were assigned randomly to two groups of hydroxyethyl starch ( Voluven ) and normal saline .

It has been shown that the subclinical inflammatory responses play important roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes . In the present study , we determined the effects of metformin on the levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( i.e. , IL-6 , TNF - α , and MCP-1 ) and anti - inflammatory mediator IL-10 in blood and urine of patients with type 2 diabetes . There were 210 patients with type 2 diabetes , which were randomized into metformin ( n = 112 ) and non - metformin ( gliclazide , acarbose , and repaglinide , n = 98 ) groups . The levels of cytokines were measured by the ELISA . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We found that metformin reduced the levels of IL-6 in blood and MCP-1 in urine , but increased IL-10 levels in blood of patients with type 2 diabetes . There were no significant differences of TNF - α between metformin and non - metformin groups . Furthermore , compared to individual drug treatment , metformin significantly reduced the levels of serum IL-6 and TNF - α , as well as urine MCP-1 . When the patients were stratified based on the durations and doses of metformin , we found that there was only change ( i.e. , increase ) in serum IL-10 levels in patients with metformin for more than 1 year compared to treatment for less than 1 year . Metformin ( 1.5 g ) treatment reduced the urinary levels of MCP-1 as compared with dose of 1.0 g in patients with type 2 diabetes .

358,4491277_0,4491277,"TITLE : Intrauterine administration of human chorionic gonadotropin does not improve pregnancy and life birth rates independently of blastocyst quality : a randomised prospective study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Successful embryo implantation depends on a well - timed maternal - embryonic crosstalk . Human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) secreted by the embryo is known to play a key role in this process and to trigger a complex signal transduction cascade allowing the apposition , attachment , and invasion of the embryo into the decidualized uterus . Production of hCG was reported to be dependent on blastocyst quality and several articles suggested that intrauterine hCG injection increases pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF patients . However , no study has as yet analysed birth rates as final outcome . Our objective was to determine whether clinical outcome after blastocyst transfer can be improved by intrauterine injection of hCG and whether this is dependent on blastocyst quality . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective randomised study was conducted in two settings . In cohort A , hCG application was performed two days before blastocyst transfer . In cohort B , the administration of hCG occurred just prior to embryo transfer on day 5 . For both cohorts , patients were randomised to either intrauterine hCG application or to the control group that received culture medium . Clinical outcome was analysed according to blastocyst quality of transferred embryos . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The outcome of 182 IVF - cycles ( cohort A ) and 1004 IVF - cycles ( cohort B ) was analysed . All patients received a fresh autologous blastocyst transfer on day five . Primary outcomes were pregnancy rates ( PR ) , clinical pregnancy rates ( cPR ) , miscarriage rates ( MR ) , and live birth rates ( LBR ) . No improvement of clinical outcome after intrauterine hCG administration on day 3 ( cohort A ) or day 5 ( cohort B ) was found , independently of blastocyst quality transferred . The final outcome in cohort A : LBR after transfer of top blastocysts was 50.0 % with hCG and 53.3 % in the control group . With non - top blastocysts , LBR of 17.1 % ( hCG ) and 18.2 % ( control ) were observed ( n.s . ) . In cohort B , LBR with top blastocysts was 53.3 % ( hCG ) and 48.4 % ( control ) , with non - top blastocysts it came to 28.7 % ( hCG ) and 35.0 % ( control ) . The differences between the groups were statistically not significant . Furthermore , we investigated a possible benefit of hCG administration in correlation with female age . In both age groups ( < 38 years and ≥ 38 years ) we found similar LBR after treatment with hCG vs. medium . A LBR of 47.1 % vs. 48.7 % was obtained in the younger group and 26.6 % vs. 30.8 % in the older group .

A total of 120 consecutive patients were allocated alternately to the two study groups : perioperative immunomodulation with IL-2 ( IL-2 group ; n=60 ) and perioperative immunomonitoring without immunomodulation ( control group ; n=60 ) . Patients from the IL-2 group received four doses of 10 × 106 IU m−2 twice daily subcutaneously a week before operation followed by a daily maintenance dose of 3 × 106 IU m−2 subcutaneously until a day before the operation . Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity ( leucocytes , T - cell markers CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 , B - cell marker CD19 , monocyte marker CD14 , natural killer ( NK ) cell markers CD16 , CD56 , and CD57 , activation markers CD6 , CD25 , CD28 , and CD69 , progenitor cell marker CD34 , as well as IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , soluble IL-2 receptor , IL-1 receptor antagonist , transforming growth factor - β1 , and vascular endothelial growth factor ) were measured in peripheral venous blood at various intervals . Interleukin-2-related toxicity was WHO grade 1 ( 24 % ) , 2 ( 67 % ) , and 3 ( 9 % ) . In the postoperative period , T - cell markers , activation markers , and NK cell markers decreased , and IL-6 and IL-10 increased . However , all these alterations were significantly less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2 . Median follow - up was 40 months .

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent which decreases the total blood loss . Patients had unilateral / bilateral cemented TKA using combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia . In a double - blind fashion , they received either placebo ( n=25 ) or tranexamic acid ( n=25)10 mg.kg−1 i.v . , just before tourniquet inflation , followed by 1 mg kg−1 h-1 i.v . till closure of the wound . The postoperative blood loss , transfusion requirement , cost effectiveness and complications were noted . The groups had similar characteristics . The mean volume of drainage fluid was 270 ml and 620 ml for unilateral(U / L ) and bilateral(B / L ) TKR patients in placebo group . Whereas it was 160ml and 286 ml respectively in unilateral(U / L ) and bilateral(B / L ) TKR patients who received tranexamic acid . This was considered statistically significant .

492,3439673_0,3439673,"TITLE : Feeding styles and child weight status among recent immigrant mother - child dyads ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Research has shown that parental feeding styles may influence children 's food consumption , energy intake , and ultimately , weight status . We examine this relationship , among recent immigrants to the US . Given that immigrant parents and children are at greater risk for becoming overweight / obese with increased time in the US , identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Baseline data was collected on 383 mother - child dyads enrolled in Live Well , a community - based , participatory , randomized controlled lifestyle intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers . Socio - demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and child . Acculturation , behavioral data , and responses to the Caregiver 's Feeding Styles Questionnaire ( CFSQ ) were also obtained from the mother . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The children 's average age was 6.2 ± 2.7 years , 58 % male . Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 ± 3.3 years , and are Brazilian ( 36 % ) , Haitian ( 34 % ) and Latino ( 30 % ) . Seventy - two percent of the mothers were overweight / obese , while 43 % of the children were overweight / obese . Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding style as being high demanding / high responsive ; 32 % as being high demanding / low responsive ; 34 % as being low demanding / high responsive and 18 % as being low demanding / low responsive . In bivariate analyses , feeding styles significantly differed by child BMIz - score , ethnic group , and mother 's perceived stress . In multiple linear regression , a low demanding / high responsive feeding style was found to be positively associated ( ß = 0.56 ) with a higher child weight as compared to high demanding / high responsive , controlling for known covariates ( p = 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Most mothers report having a low demanding / high responsive feeding style , which is associated with higher child weight status in this diverse immigrant population . This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding style may be a risk factor for childhood obesity . Further research is needed to help understand the larger socio - cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes . How parents establish a certain feeding style in their home country compared to when they move to the US "" obesogenic "" environment , should also be explored .",ig,low demanding/high responsive feeding style || high demanding/high responsive feeding style || child weight,"[(311, 354)]",0,dev,ig

The optimum fluid regimen has not been established . This prospective , randomized , blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid ( hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution ( Hartmann 's Solution ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid ( N = 60 ) or crystalloid ( N = 60 ) intra - operatively . The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting . Patients were interviewed to assess nausea , vomiting , anti - emetic use , dizziness , sore throat , headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2 , 24 and 48 hours post operatively . Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea ( 38.2 % vs 17.9 % , P = 0.03 ) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively ( 1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2 , P = 0.028 ) . The incidence of vomiting and anti - emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups . Sore throat , dizziness , headache and general well being were not different between the groups . A comparable reduction on post - operative FVC and FEV-1 and PEFR was observed in both groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Intra - operative administration of colloid increased the incidence of early postoperative nausea and has no advantage over crystalloid for symptom control after gynaecological laparoscopic surgery .",ig,Intravenous colloid || Intravenous crystalloid || Use of anti-emetic drugs,"[(224, 243)]",0,dev,ig

This study aims to determine the cost - effectiveness of the COACH program in comparison with usual care from a societal perspective . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A controlled clinical trial was performed at the Internal Medicine department of a general teaching hospital . All admitted patients using at least one prescription drug were included . The COACH program consisted of medication reconciliation , patient counselling at discharge , and communication to healthcare providers in primary care . The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an unplanned rehospitalisation within three months after discharge . Also , the number of quality - adjusted life - years ( QALYs ) was assessed . Cost data were collected using cost diaries . Uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost - effectiveness ratios between the groups was estimated by bootstrapping . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the COACH program , 168 patients were included and in usual care 151 patients . There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with unplanned rehospitalisations ( mean difference 0.17 % , 95 % CI -8.85;8.51 ) , and in QALYs ( mean difference -0.0085 , 95 % CI -0.0170;0.0001 ) . Total costs for the COACH program were non - significantly lower than usual care ( -€1160 , 95 % CI -3168;847 ) . Cost - effectiveness planes showed that the program was not cost - effective compared with usual care for unplanned rehospitalisations and QALYs gained . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The COACH program was not cost - effective in comparison with usual care . Future studies should focus on high risk patients and include other outcomes ( e.g. adverse drug events ) as this may increase the chances of a cost - effective intervention .

Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events .

Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period . We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats ( > 200 gr , > 6 week ) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model . Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin ( OC ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period . The results were analyzed and compared between groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups , their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group . The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension ( 60.14 ± 11.73 ng / mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng / mL ; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU / mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng / mL ; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium . This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation , may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis . Thus calcitriol supplementation could be an available , economic and effective strategy for preventing bone metabolic changes related to weightlessness commonly encountered in space flight .

ABSTRACT : OBJECTIVE — The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of an insulin priming dose with a continuous insulin infusion versus two continuous infusions without a priming dose . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This prospective randomized protocol used three insulin therapy methods : 1 ) load group using a priming dose of 0.07 units of regular insulin per kg body weight followed by a dose of 0.07 unit · kg−1 · h−1 i.v . in 12 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) ; 2 ) no load group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0.07 unit · kg body weight−1 · h−1 without a loading dose in 12 patients with DKA , and 3 ) twice no load group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0.14 · kg−1 · h−1 without a loading dose in 13 patients with DKA . Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA . RESULTS — The load group reached a peak in free insulin value ( 460 μU / ml ) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 μU / ml in 60 min . The twice no load group reached a peak ( 200 μU / ml ) at 45 min . The no load group reached a peak ( 60 μU / ml ) in 60–120 min . Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10 % ; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not . Except for these differences , times to reach glucose ≤250 mg / dl , pH ≥7.3 , and HCO3− ≥15 mEq / l did not differ significantly among the three groups . CONCLUSIONS — A priming dose in low - dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit · kg body weight−1 · h−1 ( about 10 units / h in a 70-kg patient ) is given .",scaled attention,Insulin 0.07 IU/kg infusion || Insulin 0.07 IU/kg load + 0.07 IU/kg infusion || Time for reaching glucose predetermined values,"[(295, 323)]",3,dev,scaled attention

We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in - between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk . Twenty - six healthy adults ( 24.7 ± 3.2 y ; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg / m2 ) participated in a 4-week cross - over intervention and consumed orange juice ( 20 % of energy requirement ) either together with 3 meals / d ( WM ) or in - between 3 meals / d ( BM ) at ad libitum energy intake . Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity ( primary outcome ) , daylong glycaemia , glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed . Body fat mass was measured by air - displacement plethysmography . After BM - intervention , fat mass increased ( +1.0 ± 1.8 kg ; p < 0.05 ) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease ( ΔMatsudaISI : −0.89 ± 2.3 ; p = 0.06 ) .

162,3687261_3,3687261,"TITLE : Effects of a ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : Macronutrient "" preloads "" can reduce postprandial glycemia by slowing gastric emptying and stimulating glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion . An ideal preload would entail minimal additional energy intake and might be optimized by concurrent inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . We evaluated the effects of a low - energy d - xylose preload , with or without sitagliptin , on gastric emptying , plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations , and postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes . ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Twelve type 2 diabetic patients were studied on four occasions each . After 100 mg sitagliptin ( S ) or placebo ( P ) and an overnight fast , patients consumed a preload drink containing either 50 g d - xylose ( X ) or 80 mg sucralose ( control [ C ] ) , followed after 40 min by a mashed potato meal labeled with 13C - octanoate . Blood was sampled at intervals . Gastric emptying was determined . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Both peak blood glucose and the amplitude of glycemic excursion were lower after PX and SC than PC ( P < 0.01 for each ) and were lowest after SX ( P < 0.05 for each ) , while overall blood glucose was lower after SX than PC ( P < 0.05 ) . The postprandial insulin - to - glucose ratio was attenuated ( P < 0.05 ) and gastric emptying was slower ( P < 0.01 ) after d - xylose , without any effect of sitagliptin . Plasma GLP-1 concentrations were higher after d - xylose than control only before the meal ( P < 0.05 ) but were sustained postprandially when combined with sitagliptin ( P < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In type 2 diabetes , acute administration of a d - xylose preload reduces postprandial glycemia and enhances the effect of a DPP-4 inhibitor .",attention,sitagliptin and d-xylose || placebo and sucralose || amplitude of glycemic excursion,"[(177, 231)]",1,dev,attention

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent which decreases the total blood loss . Patients had unilateral / bilateral cemented TKA using combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia . In a double - blind fashion , they received either placebo ( n=25 ) or tranexamic acid ( n=25)10 mg.kg−1 i.v . , just before tourniquet inflation , followed by 1 mg kg−1 h-1 i.v . till closure of the wound . The postoperative blood loss , transfusion requirement , cost effectiveness and complications were noted . The groups had similar characteristics . The mean volume of drainage fluid was 270 ml and 620 ml for unilateral(U / L ) and bilateral(B / L ) TKR patients in placebo group . Whereas it was 160ml and 286 ml respectively in unilateral(U / L ) and bilateral(B / L ) TKR patients who received tranexamic acid . This was considered statistically significant . Control group patients received 26 units of PRBC as compared to 4 units in tranexamic acid groups ( p<0.001 ) . This was again statistically significant .

Delivering brief alcohol interventions to employees as part of a health check may be acceptable , particularly with online delivery which can provide privacy for this stigmatised behaviour . Research to support this approach is limited and methodologically weak . The aim was to determine the effectiveness of online screening and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption , delivered in a workplace as part of a health check . ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS : This two - group online individually randomised controlled trial recruited employees from a UK - based private sector organisation ( approx . 100,000 employees ) . 3,375 employees completed the online health check in the three week recruitment period . Of these , 1,330 ( 39 % ) scored five or more on the AUDIT - C ( indicating alcohol misuse ) and were randomised to receive personalised feedback on their alcohol intake , alongside feedback on other health behaviours ( n = 659 ) , or to receive feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol intake ( n = 671 ) . Participants were mostly male ( 75 % ) , with a median age of 48 years and half were in managerial positions ( 55 % ) . Median Body Mass Index was 26 , 12 % were smokers , median time undertaking moderate / vigorous physical activity a week was 173 minutes and median fruit and vegetable consumption was three portions a day . Eighty percent ( n = 1,066 ) of participants completed follow - up questionnaires at three months . An intention to treat analysis found no difference between experimental groups for past week drinking ( primary outcome ) ( 5.6 % increase associated with the intervention ( 95 % CI −4.7 % to 16.9 % ; p = .30 ) ) , AUDIT ( measure of alcohol - related harm ) and health utility ( EQ-5D ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : There was no evidence to support the use of personalised feedback within an online health check for reducing alcohol consumption among employees in this organisation . Further research is needed on how to engage a larger proportion of employees in screening .

349,3750227_1,3750227,"TITLE : Risk of hyperkalemia in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease initiating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers : a randomized study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are renoprotective but both may increase serum potassium concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The proportion of affected patients , the optimum follow - up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , phase IV , controlled , crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control . With the exception of withdrawals , each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each , with a 1-week wash - out period between treatments . Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples . We used the Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups . Comparisons were also made using independent two - sample t - tests and Welch 's t - test . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed when necessary . We used either a Mann – Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly ( 0.3 mmol / L and 0.24 mmol / L respectively ) . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol / L did not differ between treatments : 37 % for olmesartan and 40 % for enalapril . The mean e - GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study . The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar ( 23 % in olmesartan and 29 % in enalapril patients ) in the 4 weeks time point . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia , even after a two month period , did not differ between treatments . There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups . The follow - up of these patients should include control of potassium levels , at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment .

This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma . The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic ( n = 13 ) or abdominal hysterectomy ( n = 11 ) . Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision , at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum IL-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group , and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay ( P < 0.05 ) . The peak serum IL-6 ( P < 0.05 ) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group ( P < 0.05 ) , while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups . The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP ( r = 0.796 ; P < 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The laparoscopic surgical procedure leaves the endocrine metabolic response largely unaltered as compared with that of open abdominal hysterectomy , but it reduces the inflammatory response as measured by the IL-6 and CRP levels .",scaled attention,Laparoscopic hysterectomy || Abdominal hysterectom || Cortisol levels,"[(187, 244)]",3,dev,scaled attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters .

Additionally , the in - patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared . 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD - VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine ( 910 mg / m2 at day 1–3 ) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide . Patients were stratified according to pretreatment . HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin ( 500 mg / m2 / d over 18 h ) , ifosfamide ( 4 g / m2 / d over 4 h ) and etoposide ( 500 mg / m2 / d ) all given for 3 consecutive days . All patients received prophylactic application of G - CSF ( 5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously ) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment . Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity , gastrointestinal side effects , haematopoietic recovery , as well as frequency of fever and infections . The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was 10 % from baseline in the amifostine group ( 105 to 95 ml min−1 ) and 37 % in the control patient group ( 107 to 67 ml min−1 ) ( P < 0.01 ) . Amifostine - treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion . Stomatitis grade III / IV occurred in 25 % without versus 0 % of patients with amifostine ( P = 0.01 ) . Acute nausea / vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists / dexamethasone / trifluorpromazine . However , delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients . Engraftment of neutrophil ( > 500 μl−1 ) and thrombocytes ( > 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12 , respectively , both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm . In addition , a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm . The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30 % savings in costs for supportive care ( Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient ) . Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine , calculation of in - patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm . This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD - VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine . Additionally , a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine - treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned .

A conclusion is yet to be reached on the role of crystalloids and colloids in immediate fluid therapy . This study was done to determine the suitable solution in immediate resuscitation of patients with hemorrhagic shock caused by tissue trauma . ABSTRACT.METHODS : One hundred trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock , who underwent fluid therapy in the emergency unit , were assigned randomly to two groups of hydroxyethyl starch ( Voluven ) and normal saline .

We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms , and levels of proinflammatory cytokines , brain - derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers , would predict or impact treatment response . ABSTRACT.METHOD : : Seventy - nine participants ( 10 dropouts ) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self - report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation ( containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum ) or a matched placebo , in a double - blind trial for 8 weeks . Data were analysed as intent - to - treat . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure ( Cohen 's d range = 0.07–0.16 ) or any blood - based biomarker . At end - point , 9 ( 23 % ) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60 % change on the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( responders ) , compared to 10 ( 26 % ) of those in the placebo group ( χ12=0.107 , p = ns ) . Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures . Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : : This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood , or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers . The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity , chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample ; recruiting an antidepressant - naive sample experiencing mild , acute symptoms of low mood , may well yield a different result . Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective . Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area .

Group I received lignocaine 1 % ( 9ml ) with normal saline ( 1ml ) , group II lignocaine1 % ( 9ml ) with neostigmine 100μg in saline ( 1ml ) and group III received lignocaine 1 % ( 9ml ) with neostigmine 200μg in NS ( 1ml ) . Group I served as a control . In operating room , after putting epidural catheter , general anesthesia was administered with propofol ( 2 mg kg-1 ) , succinylcholine ( 2 mg kg-1 ) and maintained with O2 , N2O , relaxant technique . At the end of surgery , patients were reversed . Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia . Intensity of pain relief on VAS , duration of analgesia , level of sensory block , motor blockade , sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia ( dose independent ) and sedation ( dose dependent ) . Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups . There was no incidence of respiratory depression , pruritus , bradycardia or hypotension in any group . Two patients in control group and one , receiving neostigmine ( 200μg ) , developed nausea / vomiting . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time .",attention,Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml) || group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml) || duration of analgesia,"[(256, 278)]",1,dev,attention

Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period . We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats ( > 200 gr , > 6 week ) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model . Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin ( OC ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period . The results were analyzed and compared between groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups , their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group . The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension ( 60.14 ± 11.73 ng / mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng / mL ; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU / mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng / mL ; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium . This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation , may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis . Thus calcitriol supplementation could be an available , economic and effective strategy for preventing bone metabolic changes related to weightlessness commonly encountered in space flight .

A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the efficacy of alvimopan in reducing postoperative ileus and length of stay in cystectomy ; however , a major limitation was the exclusion of epidural analgesia . ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : Eighty – six cystectomy and urinary diversion procedures performed by seven surgeons were analyzed between January 2008 and April 2012 . The first 50 patients did not receive alvimopan perioperatively , while the subsequent 36 received a single dose of 12 mg preoperatively and then 12 mg every 12 hours for 15 doses or until discharge . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The groups were equal with respect to age , gender , indication , surgeon , and type of diversion . Patients who received alvimopan experienced a shorter length of stay ( LOS ) versus those in who did not receive alvimopan ( 10.5 vs. 8.6 days , p = 0.005 , 95 % CI 0.6–3.3 ) . Readmission for ileus was low in both alvimopan and control groups ( 0 % and 4.4 % , respectively ) . Costs were significantly lower in the alvimopan group than the control groups ( 2012 USD 32,443 vs. 40,604 p < 0.001 ) . This difference stood up to multivariate analysis with a $ 7,062 difference in hospital stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Use of alvimopan in the routine perioperative care of our cystectomy and urinary diversion patients has decreased LOS by 1.9 days . Additionally , institution of routine perioperative alvimopan has reduced costs by $ 7,062 per admission ( 20 % reduction ) .

However , impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure . Mechanical insufflation - exsufflation ( MI - E ) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV . We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI - E as part of an extubation protocol . ABSTRACT.METHOD : Patients with mechanical ventilation ( MV ) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria , who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial ( SBT ) , were randomly allocated before extubation , either for ( A ) a conventional extubation protocol ( control group ) , or ( B ) the MI - E extubation protocol ( study group ) . During the postextubation period ( 48 hours ) , group A patients received standard medical treatment ( SMT ) , including NIV in case of specific indications , whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in - exsufflation ( MI - E ) . Reintubation rates , ICU length of stay , and NIV failure rates were analyzed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Seventy - five patients ( 26 women ) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group ( n = 40 ; mean SAPS II , 47.8 ± 17.7 ) and to a study group ( n = 35 ; mean SAPS II , 45.0 ± 15.0 ) . MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group , respectively . In the 48 hours after extubation , 20 control patients ( 50 % ) and 14 study patients ( 40 % ) used NIV . Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls ; six patients ( 17 % ) versus 19 patients ( 48 % ) , P < 0.05 ; respectively , and a significantly lower time under MV ; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days ; P < 0.05 ; respectively . Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV , the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ; two patients ( 6 % ) versus 13 ( 33 % ) ; P < 0.05 , respectively . Mean ICU length of stay after extubation was significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ( 3.1 ± 2.5 versus 9.8 ± 6.7 days ; P < 0.05 ) . No differences were found in the total ICU length of stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Inclusion of MI - E may reduce reintubation rates with consequent reduction in postextubation ICU length of stay .

115,4472927_5,4472927,"TITLE : Effect of ABSTRACT : Different amounts of ingested alcohol can have distinct effects on the human body . However , there is limited research on chronic alcohol consumption with Helicobacter pylori infection . We sought to investigate the relationship between the cytokine profile , oxidative balance and H. pylori infection in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption . A total of 142 subjects were divided into three groups : 59 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion and H. pylori infection ( group A ) ; 53 subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion without H. pylori infection ( group B ) ; and 30 control subjects ( group C ) . The serum levels of CagA , interleukin ( IL)-10 , E - selectin , TNF - α , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . We found that the ages and serum H. pylori CagA levels among the three groups , as well as both the mean drinking age and the mean daily alcohol consumption between groups A and B , were matched and comparable . Comparing the BMIs among the three groups , the BMI differences were found to be statistically significant ( F=3.921 , P<0.05 ) . Compared with group C , the BMIs in groups A and B were significantly higher ( P<0.001 and P<0.01 , respectively ) ; however , the BMI differences between group A and group B were not statistically significant ( P>0.05 ) . Additionally , no differences in the serum CagA levels were found in comparisons among the groups ( all P>0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B ( serum IL-10 : P<0.05 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) . The serum IL-10 in group A was significantly higher than that in group C ( P<0.01 ) ; the serum E - selectin levels in group A did not significantly differ compared with those in group C ( P>0.05 ) . Furthermore , the serum IL-10 and E - selectin levels in group B were significantly higher than those in group C ( serum IL-10 : P<0.001 ; E - selectin : P<0.05 ) ; however , the serum TNF - α levels did not differ among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . Although the serum levels of MDA and SOD in groups A and B were slightly lower than those in group C , there were no significant differences among groups ( all P>0.05 ) . In conclusion , we believe that H. pylori infection might cause a significant inhibition of certain cytokine profiles in subjects with chronic alcohol ingestion . Moreover , chronically ingested alcohol may exert an adjusted inflammatory effect , but there was no association between H. pylori infection , chronic alcohol consumption and oxidative balance .",attention,Alcohol consumption || Control || E-selectin,"[(350, 384)]",1,dev,attention

ABSTRACT.METHODS : In an open - label randomized trial , HIV - infected patients were randomized to switch from zidovudine / lamivudine ( AZT/3TC ) to abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) or tenofovir / emtricitabine ( TDF / FTC ) . We measured bone mass density ( BMD ) and bone turnover biomarkers ( osteocalcin , osteocalcin , procollagen type 1 N - terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) , alkaline phosphatase , type I collagen cross - linked C - telopeptide ( CTx ) , and osteoprotegerin ) . We assessed renal function by estimated creatinine clearance , plasma cystatin C , and urinary levels of creatinine , albumin , cystatin C , and neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) . The changes from baseline in BMD and renal and bone biomarkers were compared across study arms . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of 40 included patients , 35 completed 48 weeks of randomized therapy and follow up . BMD was measured in 33 , 26 , and 27 patients at baseline , week 24 , and week 48 , respectively . In TDF / FTC - treated patients we observed significant reductions from baseline in hip and lumbar spine BMD at week 24 ( −1.8 % and −2.5 % ) and week 48 ( −2.1 % and −2.1 % ) , whereas BMD was stable in patients in the ABC/3TC arm . The changes from baseline in BMD were significantly different between study arms . All bone turnover biomarkers except osteoprotegerin increased in the TDF / FTC arm compared with the ABC/3TC arm , but early changes did not predict subsequent loss of BMD . Renal function parameters were similar between study arms although a small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF - treated patients . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Switching to TDF / FTC - based therapy led to decreases in BMD and increases in bone turnover markers compared with ABC/3TC - based treatment .

We investigated the possible effects of Bifidobacterium animalisssp . lactis 420 ( B420 ) and the dietary fiber Litesse ® Ultra polydextrose ( LU ) on body fat mass and other obesity - related parameters . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 225 healthy volunteers ( healthy , BMI 28–34.9 ) were randomized into four groups ( 1:1:1:1 ) , using a computer - generated sequence , for 6 months of double - blind , parallel treatment : 1 ) Placebo , microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 2 ) LU , 12 g / d ; 3 ) B420 , 1010 CFU / d in microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 4 ) LU + B420 , 12 g + 1010 CFU / d . Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",scaled attention,Litesse® Ultra polydextrose  ́+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 || Placebo || Body fat mass,"[(319, 434)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Preliminary trial . Standardbreds underwent four arthrocentesis procedures within 48 h and exhibited elevated CS and no changes in PGE2 . Exercise trial . this randomized crossover design used twelve Standardbred mares which received either treatment ( 3000 IU d−1 oral SOD powder ) or placebo ( cellulose powder ) for 6 wks which culminated with them running a repeated sprint exercise test ( RSET ) . Samples were collected before ( PRE ) , during ( PEAK ) , and following exercise ( POST ) . Exercise resulted in increased ( P < 0.05 ) antioxidant defenses including erythrocyte SOD , total glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , gene transcripts for interferon - gamma , interleukin-10 , and interleukin-1β in blood , and decreased plasma nitric oxide . Exercise increased ( P < 0.05 ) SF CS and adjusted - PGE2 , and higher ( P < 0.05 ) CS and PGE2 were found in hock versus carpus joints . No treatment effects were detected .

610,5029174_1,5029174,"TITLE : Job Maintenance through Supported Employment PLUS : A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : Sickness absence from work due to experienced distress and mental health issues has continuously increased over the past years in Germany . To investigate how this alarming development can be counteracted , we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating a job coaching intervention to maintain the working capacity of members of staff and ultimately prevent sickness absence . Our sample included N = 99 employees who reported mental distress due to work - related problems . The intervention group ( n = 58 ) received between 8 and 12 individual job coaching sessions in which they worked with a professional job coach to reduce their mental distress . The control group ( n = 41 ) received a brochure about mental distress . Data were collected before the start of the study , at the end of the job coaching intervention , and at a 3-month follow - up . These data included the number of sickness absence days as the primary outcome and questionnaire measures to assess burnout indicators , life satisfaction , and work - related experiences and behaviors . Compared with the control group , the results indicated no reduction in sickness absence in the intervention group but fewer depressive symptoms , a heightened ability of the participants to distance themselves from work , more experience of work - related success , less depletion of emotional resources , and a greater satisfaction with life when participants had received the job coaching . Thus , although we could not detect a reduction in sickness absence between the groups , job coaching was shown to be a viable intervention technique to benefit employees by contributing to re - establish their mental health . We discuss the implications of the study and outline future research .",deeplift,Job coaching sessions || Control || Sickness absence,"[(197, 215)]",2,dev,deeplift

ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : 191 chemotherapy - naïve patients were randomized to receive TOMOX or FOLFOX4 . Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Overall response rate was the primary endpoint . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 183 patients were included in the intent - to - treat analysis ( 92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4 ) . Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % ( p = 0.003 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival ( 15.6 and 17.2 months ; p = 0.475 ) ; progression - free survival ( 7.7 and 8.7 months ; p = 0.292 ) , and response duration ( 6.4 and 7.6 months ; p = 0.372 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia ( p < 0.0001 ) and leukopenia ( p = 0.028 ) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen , while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group ( p = ns ) . There were two treatment - related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm . Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks , and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks ; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first - line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity .

In a prospective , single - site , open - label , non - randomized , controlled , pilot trial , we evaluated a polyherbal formulation ( PHF ) for its safety and efficacy in treating subjects with HIV - AIDS . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : A total of 32 and 31 subjects were enrolled under the PHF and highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) arms , respectively , and followed up for a period of 24 months . Plasma viral RNA , CD4 cell count and blood chemistry were monitored at 3-month intervals . Following mid - term safety evaluation , 12 subjects from the PHF arm were shifted to HAART and were followed separately as PHF - to - HAART arm , for the rest of the period . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count ( 154.4 cells / μl / year , P<0.001 ) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months ( -0.431 + 0.004 log10 IU / month , P<0.001 ) . In contrast , the PHF arm showed a profile of CD4 cell loss at remarkably slower kinetics ( 14.3 cells / μl / year , P=0.021 ) and insignificant reduction in the viral load . The PHF and HAART arms did not differ significantly in the occurrence of AIDS - related illnesses over the study period of 24 months . In the PHF - to - HAART arm , the rates of CD4 count and reduction in viral load were significant and comparable to that of the HAART group . In the PHF arm , at 1 month , a significant increase in CD4 cell count and a concomitant decrease in viral load were seen . ABSTRACT.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS : : The PHF appears to have provided protection by delaying the kinetics of CD4 cell reduction . Given the several study limitations , drawing assertive inferences from the data is challenging . Future studies with a stringent study design are warranted to confirm these findings .",scaled attention,Highly active antiretroviral treatment || No treatment || CD4 count,"[(185, 230)]",3,dev,scaled attention
603,3759706_4,3759706,"TITLE : Up - dosing with bilastine results in improved effectiveness in cold contact urticaria ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Cold contact urticaria ( CCU ) is characterized by itchy wheal and flare responses due to the release of histamine and other pro - inflammatory mediators after exposure to cold . The treatment of choice is nonsedating antihistamines , dosages of which may be increased up to fourfold if standard doses are ineffective . Here , we assess the effects of a standard 20 mg dose and up - dosing to 40 and 80 mg of bilastine in reducing the symptoms of CCU and inflammatory mediator release following cold challenge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty patients with CCU were included in this randomized , crossover , double - blind , placebo - controlled 12-week study . They received placebo , 20 , 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods . The primary readout was change in critical temperature thresholds ( CTT ) . Secondary readouts were changes in pruritus , levels of histamine IL-6 , IL-8 and TNF - α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective ( P < 0.0001 ) in reducing CTT . Up - dosing to 80 mg significantly ( P < 0.04 ) increased its effectiveness . At this dose , 19 of 20 ( 95 % ) patients responded to treatment , with 12 of 20 ( 60 % ) becoming symptom free . Only one patient was refractory to treatment . Microdialysis levels of histamine , IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) decreased following up - dosing with 80 mg bilastine . Bilastine treat - ment was well tolerated without evidence of increased sedation with dose escala - tion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Bilastine was effective in reducing the symptoms of patients with CCU . Increased efficacy of bilastine with fourfold up - dosing was without sedation and supports urticaria treatment guidelines .",attention,Bilastine updosing to 80 mg || placebo || IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge,"[(264, 295)]",1,dev,attention

The proportion of affected patients , the optimum follow - up period and whether there are differences between drugs in the development of this complication remain to be ascertained . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , phase IV , controlled , crossover study we recruited 30 patients with stage 3 CKD under restrictive eligibility criteria and strict dietary control . With the exception of withdrawals , each patient was treated with olmesartan and enalapril separately for 3 months each , with a 1-week wash - out period between treatments . Patients were clinically assessed on 10 occasions via measurements of serum and urine samples . We used the Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel statistics for comparison of categorical data between groups . Comparisons were also made using independent two - sample t - tests and Welch 's t - test . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed when necessary . We used either a Mann – Whitney or Kruskal - Wallis test if the distribution was not normal or the variance not homogeneous . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Enalapril and olmesartan increased serum potassium levels similarly ( 0.3 mmol / L and 0.24 mmol / L respectively ) . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia higher than 5 mmol / L did not differ between treatments : 37 % for olmesartan and 40 % for enalapril . The mean e - GFR ranged 46.3 to 48.59 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those treated with olmesartan and 46.8 to 48.3 ml / mint/1.73 m2 in those with enalapril and remained unchanged at the end of the study . The decreases in microalbuminuria were also similar ( 23 % in olmesartan and 29 % in enalapril patients ) in the 4 weeks time point . The percentage of patients presenting hyperkalemia , even after a two month period , did not differ between treatments . There were no appreciable changes in sodium and potassium urinary excretion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Disturbances in potassium balance upon treatment with either olmesartan or enalapril are frequent and without differences between groups . The follow - up of these patients should include control of potassium levels , at least after the first week and the first and second month after initiating treatment .

303,5107204_0,5107204,"TITLE : Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics and Population Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic Modelling of Bilastine , a Second - Generation Antihistamine , in Healthy Japanese Subjects ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Bilastine is a novel second - generation antihistamine for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinitis and urticaria . The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and tolerability of bilastine following single and multiple oral doses in healthy Japanese subjects . The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were compared with those reported in Caucasian subjects . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In a single - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel - group , single- and multiple - ascending dose study , bilastine tablets were administered at single doses of 10 , 20 , and 50 mg ( Part I ) , and once daily for 14 days at 20 and 50 mg ( Part II ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After single oral doses , maximum plasma concentrations ( C max ) were reached at 1.0–1.5 h postdose . Plasma exposure [ C max and area under the plasma concentration - time curve ( AUC ) ] increased dose - proportionally at single doses of 10–50 mg . In repeated - dose administration , no remarkable differences were observed between Day 1 and Day 14 for C max or AUC . For inhibitory effects on wheal and flare response , bilastine 20 and 50 mg showed significant inhibition from 1.5 h after administration as compared with placebo , and the significant effect persisted for 24 h after administration . The rates of adverse events ( AEs ) were comparable between bilastine and placebo in both Part I and Part II . In addition , no dose- or administration period - dependent tendency of increase in rate of AEs or worsening of severity was observed .

Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",ig,vitamin A group || placebo group || serum ferritin level,"[(208, 255)]",0,dev,ig

The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant therapy with uracil - tegafur and leucovorin ( UFT / LV ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : In the multicenter , open - label , phase III trial , patients undergoing curative resection of CLM were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the UFT / LV group or surgery alone group . The UFT / LV group orally received 5 cycles of adjuvant UFT / LV ( UFT 300mg / m2 and LV 75mg / day for 28 days followed by a 7-day rest per cycle ) . The primary endpoint was recurrence - free survival ( RFS ) . Secondary endpoints included overall survival ( OS ) . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Between February 2004 and December 2010 , 180 patients ( 90 in each group ) were enrolled into the study . Of these , 3 patients ( 2 in the UFT / LV group and 1 in the surgery alone group ) were excluded from the efficacy analysis . Median follow - up was 4.76 ( range , 0.15–9.84 ) years . The RFS rate at 3 years was higher in the UFT / LV group ( 38.6 % , n = 88 ) than in the surgery alone group ( 32.3 % , n = 89 ) . The median RFS in the UFT / LV and surgery alone groups were 1.45 years and 0.70 years , respectively . UFT / LV significantly prolonged the RFS compared with surgery alone with the hazard ratio of 0.56 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.38–0.83 ; P = 0.003 ) . The hazard ratio for death of the UFT / LV group against the surgery alone group was not significant ( 0.80 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.48–1.35 ; P = 0.409 ) .

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index ( GI ) and anti - hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats . Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) . No significant differences ( p > 0.05 ) in insulin , cholesterol measurements ( total cholesterol , LDL - C , HDL - C , triglycerides and cholesterol ratios ) and atherogenic index between or within groups were observed . All other measurements ( AST , ALT , ALP , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were normal and not significantly different between or within groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Porridge made with SDC leaf extract decreased FBG and HbA1c ( p > 0.05 ) of type 2 diabetic patients . The porridge had no effect on cholesterol measurements and no toxicity was observed at the dose tested . Therefore , the SDC porridge can be recommended as a suitable meal for diabetic patients .",scaled attention,Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge (SDC) || Any other food || Atherogenic index,"[(419, 459)]",3,dev,scaled attention

377,2363753_3,2363753,"TITLE : A randomized trial of amifostine in patients with high - dose VIC chemotherapy plus autologous blood stem cell transplanation ABSTRACT : This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high - dose chemotherapy ( HD - VIC ) plus autologous bone marrow transplant ( HDCT ) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol - derivate amifostine . Additionally , the in - patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared . 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD - VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine ( 910 mg / m2 at day 1–3 ) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide . Patients were stratified according to pretreatment . HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin ( 500 mg / m2 / d over 18 h ) , ifosfamide ( 4 g / m2 / d over 4 h ) and etoposide ( 500 mg / m2 / d ) all given for 3 consecutive days . All patients received prophylactic application of G - CSF ( 5 μg kg−1 subcutaneously ) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment . Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity , gastrointestinal side effects , haematopoietic recovery , as well as frequency of fever and infections . The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was 10 % from baseline in the amifostine group ( 105 to 95 ml min−1 ) and 37 % in the control patient group ( 107 to 67 ml min−1 ) ( P < 0.01 ) . Amifostine - treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion . Stomatitis grade III / IV occurred in 25 % without versus 0 % of patients with amifostine ( P = 0.01 ) . Acute nausea / vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT3-receptor antagonists / dexamethasone / trifluorpromazine . However , delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients . Engraftment of neutrophil ( > 500 μl−1 ) and thrombocytes ( > 25 000 μl−1)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12 , respectively , both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm . In addition , a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm . The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30 % savings in costs for supportive care ( Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient ) . Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine , calculation of in - patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm . This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD - VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine . Additionally , a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine - treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned .

487,2717426_2,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Acute , exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill . These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill .

202,4371718_0,4371718,"TITLE : Effect of calcitriol supplementation and tail suspension on serum biomarkers of bone formation in rats ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Calcitriol is documented to cause significant increase in bone mass densitometry counteracting osteoporosis . Promising results of calcitriol supplementation in studies aiming space flight induced osteoporosis is little and the effect of this hormone on biomarkers of bone metabolism is not examined yet in space flight models of osteoporosis in rats . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This was an interventional animal study being performed in a 1-month period . We included 21 Sprague Dawley strain rats ( > 200 gr , > 6 week ) who were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of oral 0.03μgr calcitriol and to be submitted to tail suspension model . Rats were followed for 1 month and were tested for serum osteocalcin ( OC ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and serum calcium at the beginning and the end of the study period . The results were analyzed and compared between groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Although serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase biomarkers and total serum calcium were not significantly different within and between study groups , their levels were increased in tail suspension model compared to control group . The levels of these biomarkers were lower in those who were submitted to tail suspension model and received calcitriol supplementation compared to those who were only submitted to tail suspension ( 60.14 ± 11.73 ng / mL vs. 58.29 ± 2.69 ng / mL ; p = 0.696 for osteocalcin and 381.86 ± 99.16 mU / mL vs. 362.57 ± 27.41 ng / mL ; p = 0.635 for alkaline phosphatase ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Supplementation of daily diet with calcitriol in rats under weightlessness conditions may results in lower values for bone metabolic biomarkers of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin and serum calcium . This pattern of change in biomarkers of bone formation , may point to the capacity of calcitriol supplementation in preventing cellular process of osteoporosis . Thus calcitriol supplementation could be an available , economic and effective strategy for preventing bone metabolic changes related to weightlessness commonly encountered in space flight . The outcome of this study needs to be further studied in future trying to find more definite results .",scaled attention,Calcitriol + Hind-limb suspension || Hind-limb suspension || Osteocalcin,"[(169, 205)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events .

Outpatient IOL is an attractive option to reduce these impacts . To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient IOL methods , and potential safety concerns ( hyperstimulation ) if prostaglandins , the standard inpatient IOL medications , are used in the outpatient setting . The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility , clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter ( OPC ) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 ( IP ) for induction of labour ( IOL ) at term . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring IOL at term ( N = 101 ) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter ( OPC , n = 50 ) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 ( IP , n = 51 ) . OPC group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph . IP group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous . Main outcome measures were inpatient stay ( prior to birth , in Birthing Unit , total ) , mode of birth , induction to delivery interval , adverse reactions and patient satisfaction . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : OPC group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth ( 21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs , p < .001 ) , IP were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit ( 53 % vs. 28 % , p = .01 ) . Vaginal birth rates ( 66 % OPC Vs . 71 % IP ) , total induction to delivery time ( 33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs ) and total inpatient times ( 96 hrs OPC Vs . 105 hrs IP ) were similar . OPC group felt less pain ( significant discomfort 26 % Vs 58 % , p = .003 ) , and had more sleep ( 5.8 Vs 3.4 hours , p < .001 ) , during cervical preparation , but were more likely to require oxytocin IOL ( 88 Vs 59 % , p = .001 ) .

Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) . There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion / extension ( p = 0.269 ) , varus / valgus ( p = 0.653 ) or rotational alignment ( p = 0.485 ) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment ( p = 0.778 ) or posterior slope ( p = 0.164 ) of the tibial component . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS - TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed , however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss . MIS - TKA in combination with computer navigation is safe in terms of implant positioning .

486,2717426_1,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Acute , exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill . These observations suggest that GLP-1 and/or its analogues have the potential to manage hyperglycaemia in the critically ill .

512,3916855_1,3916855,"TITLE : Effects of Vitamin A Supplementation on Iron Status Indices and Iron Deficiency Anaemia : A Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : Iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world including developed and developing countries . Despite intensive efforts to improve the quality of life of rural and aboriginal communities in Malaysia , anaemia and IDA are still major public health problems in these communities particularly among children . A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted on 250 Orang Asli ( aboriginal ) schoolchildren in Malaysia to investigate the effects of a single high - dose of vitamin A supplementation ( 200,000 IU ) on iron status indices , anaemia and IDA status . The effect of the supplement was assessed after 3 months of receiving the supplements ; after a complete 3-day deworming course of 400 mg / day of albendazole tablets . The prevalence of anaemia was found to be high : 48.5 % ( 95 % CI = 42.3 , 54.8 ) . Moreover , 34 % ( 95 % CI = 28.3 , 40.2 ) of the children had IDA , which accounted for 70.1 % of the anaemic cases . The findings showed that the reduction in serum ferritin level and the increments in haemoglobin , serum iron and transferrin saturation were found to be significant among children allocated to the vitamin A group compared to those allocated to the placebo group ( p < 0.01 ) . Moreover , a significant reduction in the prevalence of IDA by almost 22 % than prevalence at baseline was reported among children in the vitamin A group compared with only 2.3 % reduction among children in the placebo group . In conclusion , vitamin A supplementation showed a significant impact on iron status indices and IDA among Orang Asli children . Hence , providing vitamin A supplementation and imparting the knowledge related to nutritious food should be considered in the efforts to improve the nutritional and health status of these children as a part of efforts to improve the quality of life in rural and aboriginal communities .",ig,vitamin A group || placebo group || haemoglobin,"[(208, 256)]",0,dev,ig

Among 189 adults [ 73 males , 116 females ; age = 41 to 74 years ; mean body mass index ( BMI ) = 27.3 kg / m2 ] , assessments of % BF at the baseline and six months from the baseline were conducted by performing BIA and DXA . Bland - Altman analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between % BFBIA and % BFDXA . Compared with DXA , BIA underestimated % BF [ in males : 4.6 , – 2.4 to 11.7 ( mean biases , 95 % limit of agreement ) at the baseline , 1.4 , – 7.4 to 10.2 at the endpoint , and 3.2 , – 4.8 to 11.3 in changes ; in females : 5.1 , – 2.4 to 12.7 ; 2.2 , – 6.1 to 10.4 ; and 3.0 , – 4.8 to 10.7 , respectively ] . For males and females , % BFDXA proved to be a significant predictor of the difference between DXA and BIA at the baseline , the endpoint , and in changes when BMI and age were considered ( in males : p<0.01 and R 2 = 23.1 % , 24.1 % , 20.7 % , respectively ; for females : p<0.001 and R 2 = 40.4 % , 48.8 % , 25.4 % , respectively ) . The current study suggests that BIA provides a relatively accurate prediction of % BF in individuals with normal weight , overweight , or obesity after the end of weight - loss program , but less accurate prediction of % BF in obese individuals at baseline or weight change during the weight - loss intervention program .",scaled attention,bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) || dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) || body fat percentage (%BF) underestimation in changes in males in obese or overweight Chinese adults,"[(173, 204)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",scaled attention,Litesse® Ultra polydextrose || Placebo || Body fat mass,"[(319, 335)]",3,dev,scaled attention

However , impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV failure . Mechanical insufflation - exsufflation ( MI - E ) has been proven to be very effective in patients receiving NIV . We aimed to assess the efficacy of MI - E as part of an extubation protocol . ABSTRACT.METHOD : Patients with mechanical ventilation ( MV ) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion criteria , who successfully tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial ( SBT ) , were randomly allocated before extubation , either for ( A ) a conventional extubation protocol ( control group ) , or ( B ) the MI - E extubation protocol ( study group ) . During the postextubation period ( 48 hours ) , group A patients received standard medical treatment ( SMT ) , including NIV in case of specific indications , whereas group B received the same postextubation approach plus three daily sessions of mechanical in - exsufflation ( MI - E ) . Reintubation rates , ICU length of stay , and NIV failure rates were analyzed . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Seventy - five patients ( 26 women ) with a mean age of 61.8 ± 17.3 years were randomized to a control group ( n = 40 ; mean SAPS II , 47.8 ± 17.7 ) and to a study group ( n = 35 ; mean SAPS II , 45.0 ± 15.0 ) . MV time before enrollment was 9.4 ± 4.8 and 10.5 ± 4.1 days for the control and the study group , respectively . In the 48 hours after extubation , 20 control patients ( 50 % ) and 14 study patients ( 40 % ) used NIV . Study group patients had a significant lower reintubation rate than did controls ; six patients ( 17 % ) versus 19 patients ( 48 % ) , P < 0.05 ; respectively , and a significantly lower time under MV ; 17.8 ± 6.4 versus 11.7 ± 3.5 days ; P < 0.05 ; respectively . Considering only the subgroup of patients that used NIV , the reintubation rates related to NIV failure were significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ; two patients ( 6 % ) versus 13 ( 33 % ) ; P < 0.05 , respectively . Mean ICU length of stay after extubation was significantly lower in the study group when compared with controls ( 3.1 ± 2.5 versus 9.8 ± 6.7 days ; P < 0.05 ) . No differences were found in the total ICU length of stay . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Inclusion of MI - E may reduce reintubation rates with consequent reduction in postextubation ICU length of stay .

668,4845428_2,4845428,"TITLE : Reducing surgical levels by paraspinal mapping and diffusion tensor imaging techniques in lumbar spinal stenosis ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Correlating symptoms and physical examination findings with surgical levels based on common imaging results is not reliable . In patients who have no concordance between radiological and clinical symptoms , the surgical levels determined by conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and neurogenic examination ( NE ) may lead to a more extensive surgery and significant complications . We aimed to confirm that whether the use of diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) and paraspinal mapping ( PM ) techniques can further prevent the occurrence of false positives with conventional MRI , distinguish which are clinically relevant from levels of cauda equina and/or nerve root lesions based on MRI , and determine and reduce the decompression levels of lumbar spinal stenosis than MRI + NE , while ensuring or improving surgical outcomes . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We compared the data between patients who underwent MRI + ( PM or DTI ) and patients who underwent conventional MRI + NE to determine levels of decompression for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis . Outcome measures were assessed at 2 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , and 12 months postoperatively . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : One hundred fourteen patients ( 59 in the control group , 54 in the experimental group ) underwent decompression . The levels of decompression determined by MRI + ( PM or DTI ) in the experimental group were significantly less than that determined by MRI + NE in the control group ( p = 0.000 ) . The surgical time , blood loss , and surgical transfusion were significantly less in the experimental group ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.011 , p = 0.001 , respectively ) .

Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity . We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time .

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns ' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub - Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining . We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource - limited setting . We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This study was an open label pragmatic cluster - randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation . 2550 pregnant women ( 1311 interventions and 1239 controls ) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery . 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care . The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text - message and voucher component . Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy . Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination , preventive treatment for malaria , gestational age at last antenatal care visit , and antepartum referral . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance . In the intervention group 44 % of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31 % in the control group ( OR , 2.39 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 5.55 ) . There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The wired mothers ' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services , more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred . Mobile phone applications may contribute towards improved maternal and newborn health and should be considered by policy makers in resource - limited settings .

Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Overall response rate was the primary endpoint . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 183 patients were included in the intent - to - treat analysis ( 92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4 ) . Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % ( p = 0.003 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival ( 15.6 and 17.2 months ; p = 0.475 ) ; progression - free survival ( 7.7 and 8.7 months ; p = 0.292 ) , and response duration ( 6.4 and 7.6 months ; p = 0.372 ) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4 , respectively . Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia ( p < 0.0001 ) and leukopenia ( p = 0.028 ) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen , while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group ( p = ns ) . There were two treatment - related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm . Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks , and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks ; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first - line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity . The convenient TOMOX regimen may offer an alternative to fluoropyrimidine - based regimens .",scaled attention,TOMOX || FOLFOX4 || Progression-free survival,"[(143, 197)]",3,dev,scaled attention

The optimum fluid regimen has not been established . This prospective , randomized , blinded study was designed to determine if administration of equivolumes of a colloid ( hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) reduced post operative nausea and vomiting in healthy volunteers undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy surgery compared to a crystalloid solution ( Hartmann 's Solution ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : 120 patients were randomized to receive intravenous colloid ( N = 60 ) or crystalloid ( N = 60 ) intra - operatively . The volume of fluid administered was calculated at 1.5 ml.kg-1 per hour of fasting . Patients were interviewed to assess nausea , vomiting , anti - emetic use , dizziness , sore throat , headache and subjective general well being at 30 minutes and 2 , 24 and 48 hours post operatively . Pulmonary function testing was performed on a subgroup . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : At 2 hours the proportion of patients experiencing nausea ( 38.2 % vs 17.9 % , P = 0.03 ) and the mean nausea score were increased in the colloid compared to crystalloid group respectively ( 1.49 ± 0.3 vs 0.68 ± 0.2 , P = 0.028 ) . The incidence of vomiting and anti - emetic usage was low and did not differ between the groups . Sore throat , dizziness , headache and general well being were not different between the groups .

In a randomized crossover design , 12 healthy individuals ( 6M/6F ; BMI 22.2 ± 0.4 kg / m2 ; 27 ± 1.3 years , mean ± SEM ) underwent 50 g OGTT ( A ) and 3 breakfasts ( B1 : milk and cereals ; B2 : milk , apple , and chocolate cream - filled sponge cake ; B3 : milk , apple , bread , and hazelnut chocolate cream ) to assess plasma glucose- , insulin- , and ghrelin excursions . An electroencephalography was performed before and 100 min after consumption of each load to measure the latency of frontal P300 evoked potentials as index of cognitive performance . Breakfasts B1 and B2 exhibited significantly lower glycemic and insulinemic responses as compared to A. Breakfast B3 exhibited significantly lower glycemic , but not insulinemic response , as compared to A. Final plasma ghrelin inhibition was more pronounced , albeit not significantly , in all breakfasts with respect to A. P300 latency tended to decrease following each of the three breakfasts , but B3 was the only breakfast capable to elicit a statistically significant reduction in P300 latency with respect to A ( p < 0.01 ) , suggesting ameliorated cognitive performance . Such amelioration was correlated with the 2-hour final inhibition of plasma ghrelin concentration ( r = 0.61 , p = 0.01 ) .",scaled attention,"B3: milk, apple, bread, and hazelnut chocolate cream || 50?g OGTT (A) || P300 latency incremental values","[(208, 246)]",3,dev,scaled attention
229,5571924_3,5571924,"TITLE : A prediction model for advanced colorectal neoplasia in an asymptomatic screening population ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : An electronic medical record ( EMR ) database of a large unselected population who received screening colonoscopies may minimize sampling error and represent real - world estimates of risk for screening target lesions of advanced colorectal neoplasia ( CRN ) . Our aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for assessing the probability of advanced CRN using a clinical data warehouse . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 49,450 screenees underwent their first colonoscopy as part of a health check - up from 2002 to 2012 at Samsung Medical Center , and the dataset was constructed by means of natural language processing from the computerized EMR system . The screenees were randomized into training and validation sets . The prediction model was developed using logistic regression . The model performance was validated and compared with existing models using area under receiver operating curve ( AUC ) analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the training set , age , gender , smoking duration , drinking frequency , and aspirin use were identified as independent predictors for advanced CRN ( adjusted P < .01 ) . The developed model had good discrimination ( AUC = 0.726 ) and was internally validated ( AUC = 0.713 ) . The high - risk group had a 3.7-fold increased risk of advanced CRN compared to the low - risk group ( 1.1 % vs. 4.0 % , P < .001 ) . The discrimination performance of the present model for high - risk patients with advanced CRN was better than that of the Asia - Pacific Colorectal Screening score ( AUC = 0.678 , P < .001 ) and Schroy 's CAN index ( AUC = 0.672 , P < .001 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The present 5-item risk model can be calculated readily using a simple questionnaire and can identify the low- and high - risk groups of advanced CRN at the first screening colonoscopy . This model may increase colorectal cancer risk awareness and assist healthcare providers in encouraging the high - risk group to undergo a colonoscopy .",attention,final model || Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score (APCS) || discrimination performance using AUC (Area under the receiver operating curve) for high risk patients,"[(200, 304)]",1,dev,attention

We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) .

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns ' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub - Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining . We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource - limited setting . We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This study was an open label pragmatic cluster - randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation . 2550 pregnant women ( 1311 interventions and 1239 controls ) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery . 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care . The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text - message and voucher component . Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy . Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination , preventive treatment for malaria , gestational age at last antenatal care visit , and antepartum referral . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance . In the intervention group 44 % of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31 % in the control group ( OR , 2.39 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 5.55 ) . There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The wired mothers ' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services , more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred . Mobile phone applications may contribute towards improved maternal and newborn health and should be considered by policy makers in resource - limited settings .

ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To determine outcomes for men diagnosed with advanced PCa following prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) testing who were excluded from the ProtecT randomised trial . ABSTRACT.DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Mortality was compared for 492 men followed up for a median of 7.4 yr to a contemporaneous cohort of men from the UK Anglia Cancer Network ( ACN ) and with a matched subset from the ACN . ABSTRACT.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : PCa - specific and all - cause mortality were compared using Kaplan - Meier analysis and Cox 's proportional hazards regression . ABSTRACT.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS : Of the 492 men excluded from the ProtecT cohort , 37 ( 8 % ) had metastases ( N1 , M0 = 5 , M1 = 32 ) and 305 had locally advanced disease ( 62 % ) . The median PSA was 17 μg / l . Treatments included radical prostatectomy ( RP ; n = 54 ; 11 % ) , radiotherapy ( RT ; n = 245 ; 50 % ) , androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ; n = 122 ; 25 % ) , other treatments ( n = 11 ; 2 % ) , and unknown ( n = 60 ; 12 % ) . There were 49 PCa - specific deaths ( 10 % ) , of whom 14 men had received radical treatment ( 5 % ) ; and 129 all - cause deaths ( 26 % ) . In matched ProtecT and ACN cohorts , 37 ( 9 % ) and 64 ( 16 % ) , respectively , died of PCa , while 89 ( 22 % ) and 103 ( 26 % ) died of all causes . ProtecT men had a 45 % lower risk of death from PCa compared to matched cases ( hazard ratio 0.55 , 95 % confidence interval 0.38–0.83 ; p = 0.0037 ) , but mortality was similar in those treated radically . The nonrandomised design is a limitation . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Men with PSA - detected advanced PCa excluded from ProtecT and treated radically had low rates of PCa death at 7.4-yr follow - up . Among men who underwent nonradical treatment , the ProtecT group had a lower rate of PCa death . Early detection through PSA testing , leadtime bias , and group heterogeneity are possible factors in this finding .

490,2717426_5,2717426,"TITLE : The effect of exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 on the glycaemic response to small intestinal nutrient in the critically ill : a randomised double - blind placebo - controlled cross over study ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill , affects outcome adversely , and is exacerbated by enteral feeding . Furthermore , treatment with insulin in this group is frequently complicated by hypoglycaemia . In healthy patients and those with type 2 diabetes , exogenous glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) decreases blood glucose by suppressing glucagon , stimulating insulin and slowing gastric emptying . Because the former effects are glucose - dependent , the use of GLP-1 is not associated with hypoglycaemia . The objective of this study was to establish if exogenous GLP-1 attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in patients with critical illness induced hyperglycaemia . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Seven mechanically ventilated critically ill patients , not previously known to have diabetes , received two intravenous infusions of GLP-1 ( 1.2 pmol / kg / min ) and placebo ( 4 % albumin ) over 270 minutes . Infusions were administered on consecutive days in a randomised , double - blind fashion . On both days a mixed nutrient liquid was infused , via a post - pyloric feeding catheter , at a rate of 1.5 kcal / min between 30 and 270 minutes . Blood glucose and plasma GLP-1 , insulin and glucagon concentrations were measured . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In all patients , exogenous GLP-1 infusion reduced the overall glycaemic response during enteral nutrient stimulation ( AUC30–270 min GLP-1 ( 2077 ± 144 mmol / l min ) vs placebo ( 2568 ± 208 mmol / l min ) ; P = 0.02 ) and the peak blood glucose ( GLP-1 ( 10.1 ± 0.7 mmol / l ) vs placebo ( 12.7 ± 1.0 mmol / l ) ; P < 0.01 ) . The insulin / glucose ratio at 270 minutes was increased with GLP-1 infusion ( GLP-1 ( 9.1 ± 2.7 ) vs. placebo ( 5.8 ± 1.8 ) ; P = 0.02 ) but there was no difference in absolute insulin concentrations . There was a transient , non - sustained , reduction in plasma glucagon concentrations during GLP-1 infusion ( t = 30 minutes GLP-1 ( 90 ± 12 pmol / ml ) vs. placebo ( 104 ± 10 pmol / ml ) ; P < 0.01 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Acute , exogenous GLP-1 infusion markedly attenuates the glycaemic response to enteral nutrition in the critically ill .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 40 participants with type 1 diabetes , of whom 24 were adults [ mean ± standard deviation ( s.d . ) age 43 ± 12 years and glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 8.0 ± 0.9 % ] and 16 were adolescents ( mean ± s.d . age 15.6 ± 3.6 years and HbA1c 8.1 ± 0.8 % ) , underwent two periods of sensor‐augmented pump therapy in the home setting , in combination with or without an overnight closed‐loop insulin delivery system that uses a model predictive control algorithm to direct insulin delivery . The order of the two interventions was random ; each period lasted 4 weeks in adults and 3 weeks in adolescents . The primary outcome was time during which sensor glucose readings were in the target range of 3.9–8.0 mmol / l . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The proportion of time when sensor glucose was in the target range ( 3.9–8.0 mmol / l ) overnight ( between 24:00 and 08:00 hours ) was 18.5 % greater during closed‐loop insulin delivery than during sensor‐augmented therapy ( p < 0.001 ) . Closed‐loop therapy significantly reduced mean overnight glucose levels by 0.9 mmol / l ( p < 0.001 ) , with no difference in glycaemic variability , as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose . Time spent above the target range was reduced ( p = 0.001 ) , as was time spent in hypoglycaemia ( < 3.9 mmol / l ; p = 0.014 ) during closed‐loop therapy . Lower mean overnight glucose levels during closed‐loop therapy were brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery ( p < 0.001 ) without changes to the total daily delivery ( p = 0.84 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Overnight closed‐loop insulin therapy at home in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is feasible , showing improvements in glucose control and reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia .",scaled attention,Closed‐loop insulin || Control || Overnight insulin delivered,"[(316, 350)]",3,dev,scaled attention
419,4033571_0,4033571,"TITLE : Efficacy and safety of extended - release oxcarbazepine ( Oxtellar XR ™ ) as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory partial - onset seizures : a randomized controlled trial ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy , tolerability , and safety of once - daily 1200 mg and 2400 mg SPN-804 ( Oxtellar XRTM , Supernus Pharmaceuticals ) , an extended - release tablet formulation of oxcarbazepine ( OXC ) , added to 1 - 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) in adults with refractory partial - onset seizures , with or without secondary generalization . ABSTRACT.METHODS : The Prospective , Randomized Study of OXC XR in Subjects with Partial Epilepsy Refractory ( PROSPER ) study was a multinational , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group Phase 3 study . The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in monthly ( 28-day ) seizure frequency for the 16-week double - blind treatment period in the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population with analyzable seizure data . Other efficacy analyses included proportion of patients with ≥ 50 % seizure reduction , proportion of patients seizure free , and the relationship between clinical response and plasma concentration . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Median percent reduction was -28.7 % for placebo , −38.2 % ( P = 0.08 vs placebo ) for once - daily SPN-804 1200 mg , and −42.9 % ( P = 0.003 ) for SPN-804 2400 mg . Responder rates were 28.1 % , 36.1 % ( P = 0.08 ) , and 40.7 % ( P = 0.02 ) ; 16-week seizure - free rates in a pragmatic ITT analysis were 3.3 % , 4.9 % ( P = 0.59 ) , and 11.4 % ( P = 0.008 ) , respectively . When data were analyzed separately for study site clusters , a post hoc analysis demonstrated that both SPN-804 dosages were significantly superior to placebo in median percent seizure reduction ( placebo : −13.3 % ; 1200 mg : −34.5 % , P = 0.02 ; 2400 mg : −52.7 % , P = 0.006 ) in the North American study site cluster . A concentration – response analysis also supported a clinically meaningful effect for 1200 mg . Adverse event types reflected the drug 's established profile . Adverse event frequency was consistent with a pharmacokinetic profile in which SPN-804 produces lower peak plasma concentrations vs immediate - release OXC . Once - daily dosing was not associated with any new safety signals . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Adjunctive once - daily SPN-804 improved seizure control in patients with inadequately controlled partial - onset seizures .

Dual release ciprofloxacin for inhalation ( DRCFI ) contains liposomal ciprofloxacin , formulated to optimise airway antibiotic delivery . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Phase II , 24-week Australian / New Zealand multicentre , randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in 42 adult bronchiectasis subjects with ≥2 pulmonary exacerbations in the prior 12 months and ciprofloxacin - sensitive P aeruginosa at screening . Subjects received DRCFI or placebo in three treatment cycles of 28 days on/28 days off . The primary outcome was change in sputum P aeruginosa bacterial density to the end of treatment cycle 1 ( day 28 ) , analysed by modified intention to treat ( mITT ) . Key secondary outcomes included safety and time to first pulmonary exacerbation — after reaching the pulmonary exacerbation endpoint subjects discontinued study drug although remained in the study . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : DRCFI resulted in a mean ( SD ) 4.2 ( 3.7 ) log10 CFU / g reduction in P aeruginosa bacterial density at day 28 ( vs −0.08 ( 3.8 ) with placebo , p=0.002 ) . DRCFI treatment delayed time to first pulmonary exacerbation ( median 134 vs 58 days , p=0.057 mITT , p=0.046 per protocol ) . DRCFI was well tolerated with a similar incidence of systemic adverse events to the placebo group , but fewer pulmonary adverse events . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Once - daily inhaled DRCFI demonstrated potent antipseudomonal microbiological efficacy in adults with non - CF bronchiectasis and ciprofloxacin - sensitive P aeruginosa .

A total of 120 consecutive patients were allocated alternately to the two study groups : perioperative immunomodulation with IL-2 ( IL-2 group ; n=60 ) and perioperative immunomonitoring without immunomodulation ( control group ; n=60 ) . Patients from the IL-2 group received four doses of 10 × 106 IU m−2 twice daily subcutaneously a week before operation followed by a daily maintenance dose of 3 × 106 IU m−2 subcutaneously until a day before the operation . Parameters of cellular and humoral immunity ( leucocytes , T - cell markers CD3 , CD4 , and CD8 , B - cell marker CD19 , monocyte marker CD14 , natural killer ( NK ) cell markers CD16 , CD56 , and CD57 , activation markers CD6 , CD25 , CD28 , and CD69 , progenitor cell marker CD34 , as well as IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , soluble IL-2 receptor , IL-1 receptor antagonist , transforming growth factor - β1 , and vascular endothelial growth factor ) were measured in peripheral venous blood at various intervals . Interleukin-2-related toxicity was WHO grade 1 ( 24 % ) , 2 ( 67 % ) , and 3 ( 9 % ) . In the postoperative period , T - cell markers , activation markers , and NK cell markers decreased , and IL-6 and IL-10 increased . However , all these alterations were significantly less accentuated in patients who had been pretreated with IL-2 . Median follow - up was 40 months . Tumour - specific survival in the IL-2 group and the control group was 98 vs 81 % after 1 year and 86 vs 73 % after 5 years ( P=0.04 ) . A similar effect was found for progression - free survival . We conclude that IL-2 can be safely administered in the perioperative period and modulates immunological parameters .

214,2409349_0,2409349,"TITLE : Time esophageal pH < 4 overestimates the prevalence of pathologic esophageal reflux in subjects with gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with proton pump inhibitors ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : A Stanford University study reported that in asymptomatic GERD patients who were being treated with a proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) , 50 % had pathologic esophageal acid exposure . ABSTRACT.AIM : We considered the possibility that the high prevalence of pathologic esophageal reflux might simply have resulted from calculating acidity as time pH < 4 . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We calculated integrated acidity and time pH < 4 from the 49 recordings of 24-hour gastric and esophageal pH from the Stanford study as well as from another study of 57 GERD subjects , 26 of whom were treated for 8 days with 20 mg omeprazole or 20 mg rabeprazole in a 2-way crossover fashion . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux in both studies was significantly higher when measured as time pH < 4 than when measured as integrated acidity . This difference was entirely attributable to a difference between the two measures during the nocturnal period . Nocturnal gastric acid breakthrough was not a useful predictor of pathologic nocturnal esophageal reflux . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : In GERD subjects treated with a PPI , measuring time esophageal pH < 4 will significantly overestimate the prevalence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure over 24 hours and during the nocturnal period .",attention,integrated acidity || time pH < 4 || the prevalence of pathologic 24-hour esophageal reflux,"[(145, 171)]",1,dev,attention

In a prospective , single - site , open - label , non - randomized , controlled , pilot trial , we evaluated a polyherbal formulation ( PHF ) for its safety and efficacy in treating subjects with HIV - AIDS . ABSTRACT.METHODS : : A total of 32 and 31 subjects were enrolled under the PHF and highly active antiretroviral treatment ( HAART ) arms , respectively , and followed up for a period of 24 months . Plasma viral RNA , CD4 cell count and blood chemistry were monitored at 3-month intervals . Following mid - term safety evaluation , 12 subjects from the PHF arm were shifted to HAART and were followed separately as PHF - to - HAART arm , for the rest of the period . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : The HAART arm was characterized by significant improvements in CD4 cell count ( 154.4 cells / μl / year , P<0.001 ) and reduction in plasma viral load within 3 to 6 months ( -0.431 + 0.004 log10 IU / month , P<0.001 ) . In contrast , the PHF arm showed a profile of CD4 cell loss at remarkably slower kinetics ( 14.3 cells / μl / year , P=0.021 ) and insignificant reduction in the viral load . The PHF and HAART arms did not differ significantly in the occurrence of AIDS - related illnesses over the study period of 24 months . In the PHF - to - HAART arm , the rates of CD4 count and reduction in viral load were significant and comparable to that of the HAART group . In the PHF arm , at 1 month , a significant increase in CD4 cell count and a concomitant decrease in viral load were seen . ABSTRACT.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS : : The PHF appears to have provided protection by delaying the kinetics of CD4 cell reduction . Given the several study limitations , drawing assertive inferences from the data is challenging .

This study aims to determine the cost - effectiveness of the COACH program in comparison with usual care from a societal perspective . ABSTRACT.METHODS : A controlled clinical trial was performed at the Internal Medicine department of a general teaching hospital . All admitted patients using at least one prescription drug were included . The COACH program consisted of medication reconciliation , patient counselling at discharge , and communication to healthcare providers in primary care . The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an unplanned rehospitalisation within three months after discharge . Also , the number of quality - adjusted life - years ( QALYs ) was assessed . Cost data were collected using cost diaries . Uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost - effectiveness ratios between the groups was estimated by bootstrapping . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : In the COACH program , 168 patients were included and in usual care 151 patients . There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with unplanned rehospitalisations ( mean difference 0.17 % , 95 % CI -8.85;8.51 ) , and in QALYs ( mean difference -0.0085 , 95 % CI -0.0170;0.0001 ) .

Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",scaled attention,Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 || Placebo || Body fat mass,"[(352, 456)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Eighty - one patients were compared in this retrospective review ; twenty - eight patients received our dosing regimen . All patients were mildly anemic . Epoetin - α to control ( 1 : 2 ) patient matching occurred so that one of two attending surgeons , gender , BMI , complexity of surgery , ASA score , and age were similar between groups . The clinical triggers for blood transfusion during or after the procedure were determined based on peri- and postoperative hemoglobin levels , ASA score , and/or clinical symptoms consistent with anemia . Blood salvage was not used . Results . Blood transfusion and length of stay were lower in the study group . None of the patients who received epoetin - α underwent transfusion . Hemoglobin increased from 11.97 to 13.8 , preoperatively . Hemoglobin at day of surgery and time of discharge were higher . Gender , BMI , ASA score , total and hidden blood losses , calculated blood loss , preop PLT , PT , PTT , and INR were similar between groups . One Epogen patient had an uncomplicated DVT ( 3.6 % ) . Conclusions . Epoetin - α may have a role in the mildly anemic revision knee patient . It may also decrease patient length of stay allowing for earlier readiness to resume normal activities and/or meet short - term milestones . A randomized study to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of such a treatment methodology in the mildly anemic revision patient may be warranted .",scaled attention,epoetin-α || control || average total blood loss,"[(188, 219)]",3,dev,scaled attention
435,5515881_0,5515881,"TITLE : Balance training improves memory and spatial cognition in healthy adults ABSTRACT : Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive functions . However , it is still unknown which type of exercise affects cognition . In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that a demanding balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition . Forty healthy participants aged 19–65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention . Each group exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks . Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance , cardiorespiratory fitness , memory , spatial cognition , and executive functions . Only the balance group significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest , while cardiorespiratory fitness remained unchanged in both groups . Moreover , the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition . Effects on executive functions were not observed . These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition . Therefore , an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition . It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways between the vestibular system and these brain regions .",attention,demanding balance training program || relaxation group || memory score,"[(131, 144)]",1,dev,attention

Preliminary trial . Standardbreds underwent four arthrocentesis procedures within 48 h and exhibited elevated CS and no changes in PGE2 . Exercise trial . this randomized crossover design used twelve Standardbred mares which received either treatment ( 3000 IU d−1 oral SOD powder ) or placebo ( cellulose powder ) for 6 wks which culminated with them running a repeated sprint exercise test ( RSET ) . Samples were collected before ( PRE ) , during ( PEAK ) , and following exercise ( POST ) . Exercise resulted in increased ( P < 0.05 ) antioxidant defenses including erythrocyte SOD , total glutathione , glutathione peroxidase , gene transcripts for interferon - gamma , interleukin-10 , and interleukin-1β in blood , and decreased plasma nitric oxide . Exercise increased ( P < 0.05 ) SF CS and adjusted - PGE2 , and higher ( P < 0.05 ) CS and PGE2 were found in hock versus carpus joints . No treatment effects were detected . Results suggest normal adaptive responses likely due to exercise - induced tissue microdamage and oxidative stress .

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary MH , delivered as an extract of un - ripened avocado , on energy expenditure ( EE ) in healthy adult Labrador Retriever dogs ( total of 12 dogs , 26.99 ± 0.634 kg , 4.9 ± 0.2 y ) . The study was a double - blind , cross - over with each dog receiving both dietary treatments , control ( CON ) and MH ( 400 mg / kg of diet ; 6 mg / kg BW ) , in random order . Resting and post - prandial ( 10 h ) EE and respiratory quotient ( RQ ) were determined by indirect calorimetry ( d 42 ) . The following day , body composition was assessed using dual X - ray absorptiometry . Continuous activity monitoring was conducted using an Atical ® accelerometer ( d 43–47 ) . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was obtained prior to the morning meal ( d 49 ) and 4 h after consumption of their meal ( d 56 ) to determine the protein content and phosphorylation of 5 ' adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . Diet did not affect body weight , resting EE or skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation . Dogs fed MH had significantly lower post - prandial RQ ( p = 0.02 ) and ratio of fat to lean body mass ( p = 0.02 ) . Physical activity during light time periods ( but not dark ) was lower in dogs fed MH ( p < 0.05 ) during weekends , but not on weekdays . These results suggest that MH affects energy balance of adult dogs , but that these effects are not dose dependent and not due to physical activity .",scaled attention,Mannoheptulose || Control || Physical activity during light time periods,"[(287, 317)]",3,dev,scaled attention

642,3528484_1,3528484,"TITLE : A novel model - based approach for dose determination of glycopyrronium bromide in COPD ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Glycopyrronium bromide ( NVA237 ) is an inhaled long - acting muscarinic antagonist in development for treatment of COPD . This study compared the efficacy and safety of once - daily ( OD ) and twice - daily ( BID ) glycopyrronium bromide regimens , using a novel model - based approach , in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Double - blind , randomized , dose - finding trial with an eight - treatment , two - period , balanced incomplete block design . Patients ( smoking history ≥10 pack - years , post - bronchodilator FEV1 ≥30 % and < 80 % predicted , FEV1 / FVC < 0.7 ) were randomized to one of 16 independent sequences for 28 days . Primary endpoint : mean trough FEV1 at Day 28 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : 385 patients ( mean age 61.2 years ; mean post - bronchodilator FEV1 53 % predicted ) were randomized ; 88.6 % completed . All OD and BID dosing regimens produced dose - dependent bronchodilation ; at Day 28 , increases in mean trough FEV1 versus placebo were statistically significant for all regimens , ranging from 51 mL ( glycopyrronium bromide 12.5 μg OD ) to 160 mL ( glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg BID ) . Pharmacodynamic steady - state was reached by Day 7 . There was a small separation ( ≤37 mL ) between BID and OD dose – response curves for mean trough FEV1 at steady - state in favour of BID dosing . Over 24 hours , separation between OD and BID regimens was even smaller ( FEV1 AUC0 - 24h maximum difference for equivalent daily dose regimens : 8 mL ) . Dose – response results for FEV1 at 12 hours , FEV1 AUC0 - 12h and FEV1 AUC0 - 4h at steady - state showed OD regimens provided greater improvement over placebo than BID regimens for total daily doses of 25 μg , 50 μg and 100 μg , while the reverse was true for OD versus BID regimens from 12–24 hours . The 12.5 μg BID dose produced a marginally higher improvement in trough FEV1 versus placebo than 50 μg OD , however , the response at 12 hours over placebo was suboptimal ( 74 mL ) . Glycopyrronium bromide was safe and well tolerated at all doses . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg OD provides significant bronchodilation over a 24 hour period , and in terms of FEV1 AUC0 - 24h is not significantly different than the same total daily dose administered BID . Importantly , OD dosing may confer better patient adherence . The results are consistent with previous glycopyrronium bromide studies and support once - daily dosing of glycopyrronium bromide 50 μg in patients with moderate - to - severe COPD .

Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",deeplift,Bifidobacterium animalisssp.lactis 420 || Placebo || Adverse events,"[(520, 533)]",2,dev,deeplift

Deliberate restriction of food intake ( dieting ) produces short - term weight loss but is largely unsuccessful for long - term weight management . Two promising approaches for the prevention of weight gain are intuitive eating ( ie , eating in accordance with hunger and satiety signals ) and the development of greater psychological flexibility ( ie , the aim of acceptance and commitment therapy [ ACT ] ) . ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES : This pilot study investigated the usage , acceptability , and feasibility of "" Mind , Body , Food , "" a Web - based weight gain prevention intervention prototype that teaches intuitive eating and psychological flexibility skills . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Participants were 40 overweight women ( mean age 44.8 [ standard deviation , SD , 3.06 ] years , mean body mass index [ BMI ] 32.9 [ SD 6.01 ] kg / m2 , mean Intuitive Eating Scale [ IES-1 ] total score 53.4 [ SD 7.46 ] , classified as below average ) who were recruited from the general population in Dunedin , New Zealand . Module completion and study site metrics were assessed using Google Analytics . Use of an online self - monitoring tool was determined by entries saved to a secure online database . Intervention acceptability was assessed postintervention . BMI , intuitive eating , binge eating , psychological flexibility , and general mental and physical health were assessed pre- and postintervention and 3-months postintervention . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Of the 40 women enrolled in the study , 12 ( 30 % ) completed all 12 modules ( median 7.5 [ interquartile range , IQR , 2 - 12 ] modules ) and 4 ( 10 % ) used the self - monitoring tool for all 14 weeks of the intervention period ( median 3 [ IQR 1 - 9 ] weeks ) . Among 26 women who completed postintervention assessments , most women rated "" Mind , Body , Food "" as useful ( 20/26 , 77 % ) , easy to use ( 17/25 , 68 % ) and liked the intervention ( 22/25 , 88 % ) . From pre- to postintervention , there were statistically significant within - group increases in intuitive eating ( IES-2 total score P<.001 ; all IES-2 subscale scores : P ≤.01 ) , psychological flexibility ( P=.01 ) , and general mental health ( P<.001 ) as well as significant decreases in binge eating ( P=.01 ) . At the 3-month follow - up , IES-2 improvements were maintained , and there were further improvements in binge eating ( P<.001 ) and general mental health ( P=.03 ) , and a marginal yet nonsignificant tendency for further improvement in psychological flexibility ( P=.06 ) . There were no significant within - group changes in BMI from pre- to postintervention and postintervention to 3-month follow - up ( P=.46 and P=.93 , respectively ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The "" Mind , Body , Food "" prototype Web - based intervention is appealing to middle - aged women and may be a useful tool to help women learn intuitive eating and ACT skills , reduce binge eating , and maintain weight over 3 months .

The primary outcome measure was the Health Evaluation Impact Questionnaire ( heiQ ) to evaluate 8 different domains ( health - directed activity , positive and active engagement in life , emotional distress , self - monitoring and insight , constructive attitudes and approaches , skill and technique acquisition , social integration and support , health service navigation ) and the secondary outcome measure was the 17-item Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator ( OAQI ) questionnaire to evaluate the change in appropriateness of care received by participants . Independent t tests were used to compare changes between groups for the heiQ and chi - square tests to identify changes within and between groups from baseline to 12 months for each OAQI item . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Baseline demographics between groups were similar for gender ( 152/195 , 77.9 % female ) , age ( mean 60 , SD 9 years ) and body mass index ( mean 31.1 , SD 6.8 kg / m2 ) . With the exception of health service navigation , mean effect sizes from all other heiQ domains showed a positive trend for My Joint Pain users compared to the nonusers , although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance . Within - group changes also showed improvements among the users of the My Joint Pain website for self - management ( absolute change score=15 % , P=.03 ) , lifestyle ( absolute change score=16 % , P=.02 ) , and physical activity ( absolute change score=11 % , P=.04 ) , with no significant improvements for the nonusers . Following 12 months of exposure to the website , there were significant improvements for users compared to nonusers in self - management ( absolute change score 15 % vs 2 % , P=.001 ) and weight reduction ( absolute change scores 3 % vs – 6 % , P=.03 ) measured on the OAQI . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The My Joint Pain Web resource does not significantly improve overall heiQ , but does improve other important aspects of quality of care in people with hip and/or knee OA . Further work is required to improve engagement with the website and the quality of information delivered in order to provide a greater impact .",attention,"Website users || Nonusers || Self-management as measured on the OAQI, after 12 months","[(464, 519)]",1,dev,attention
623,3620559_0,3620559,"TITLE : A pilot trial of large versus small diameter needles for oocyte retrieval ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : This study was designed to determine whether small diameter needles for oocyte retrieval alter oocyte yields in patients undergoing IVF in comparison to standard large diameter needles . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We conducted a prospective pilot study of 21 consecutive favorable prognosis patients . In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm ( thin ) or 17 G/ 35 mm ( standard ) needle , the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles ( 60.6 % ) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles ( 57.7 % ) with the thinner needle ( p = 0.23 ) .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : A prospective , randomized , international multicentre trial including 69 patients was performed to compare computer - assisted TKA ( CAS - TKA ) using either mini - midvastus ( MIS group ) or standard medial parapatellar approach ( conventional group ) . Patients from 3 centers ( Maastricht , Zwickau , Adelaide ) with end - stage osteoarthritis of the knee were randomized to either an MIS group with dedicated instrumentation or a conventional group to receive cruciate retaining CAS - TKA without patella resurfacing . The primary outcome was to compare post operative pain and range of motion ( ROM ) . The secondary outcome was to measure the duration of surgery , blood loss , chair rise test , quadriceps strength , anterior knee pain , Knee Society Score ( KSS),WOMAC scores , mechanical leg axis and component alignment . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Patients in the MIS group ( 3.97 ± 2.16 ) had significant more pain at 2 weeks than patients in the conventional group ( 2.77 ± 1.43 ) p = 0.003 . There was no significant difference in any of the other primary outcome parameters . Surgery time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001 ) and there were significantly higher blood loss ( p = 0.002 ) in the MIS group as compared to the conventional group . The difference of the mean mechanical leg alignment between the groups was not statistically significant ( – 0.43 ° ( 95 % CI – 1.50 – 0.64 ) ; p = 0.43 ) . There was no significant difference of component alignment between the two surgical groups with respect to flexion / extension ( p = 0.269 ) , varus / valgus ( p = 0.653 ) or rotational alignment ( p = 0.485 ) of the femur component and varus valgus alignment ( p = 0.778 ) or posterior slope ( p = 0.164 ) of the tibial component . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : There was no advantage of the MIS approach compared to a conventional approach CAS - TKA in any of the primary outcome measurements assessed , however the MIS approach was associated with longer surgical time and greater blood loss .

Fresh Scoparia dulcis porridge elicited a low glycaemic index ( GI ) and anti - hyperglycaemic effects when fed to diabetic Wistar rats . Commercially produced Scoparia dulcis porridge ( SDC ) elicited medium GI . Present study was aimed at studying the anti - diabetic effects of consumption of commercially produced S. dulcis porridge . ABSTRACT.METHOD : A randomized crossover clinical trial with type 2 diabetic patients ( n = 35 ) on medication , with mild and moderate diabetes [ fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) 126–300 mg / dL , age 35–70 years ] was conducted . Within the first three months ( study period 1 ) group 1 was the test and group 2 was the control . Following a wash - out period , the two groups were crossed over ( study period 2 : group 1 – control ; group 2 - test ) . Test group consumed commercially produced SDC for 3 days / week for three months and the control group any other food . At the onset and end of each study period glucose measurements [ Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG ) , HbA1c ] , lipid measurements ( total cholesterol , HDL - C , LDL - C , triglycerides , cholesterol ratios ) , toxicity parameters ( liver enzymes , creatinine , CRP , eGFR ) were analyzed by enzyme assay kit methods using a KONELAB 20XT auto analyzer . Significances between groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA ( normal distribution ) and Mann Whitney test ( if the values were not normally distributed ) . Within group comparisons were carried out by Bonferroni post hoc test . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : During the crossover clinical trial HbA1c of group 1 decreased from 7.9 ± 0.5 to 6.5 ± 0.3 ( p = 0.003 ) while HbA1c of group 2 decreased from 7.0 ± 0.3to 6.7 ± 0.3 while in the test group . Therefore , both test groups ( 1 and 2 ) elicited a decrease in HbA1c compared to respective control groups . Both test groups elicited a non significant decrease in FBG following the intervention ( group 1 - from 174 ± 14 to 160 ± 10 mg / dL ; group 2 - from 183 ± 13 to 160 ± 7 mg / dL ) .

We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure . ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi , which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form . ABSTRACT.METHODS : We enrolled adults with elevated systolic ( 130–150 mmHg ) or diastolic ( 80–100 mmHg ) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial . Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of : 1 ) intervention — a trainer - led ChiRunning group ( n = 10 ) ; 2 ) active control — a trainer - led running group ( n = 6 ) ; or 3 ) educational control — a self - directed running group ( n = 6 ) and followed for 4 more weeks . The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : This study was feasible , meeting recruitment , retention and adherence goals , and acceptable to participants . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups . Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group ( p = 0.04 ) but not in the control group ( slope for ChiRunning −0.05 [ −0.1 to −0.002 ] vs. control −0.01 [ −0.06 to 0.04 ] , between slope difference , p = 0.22 ) . Self - reported running - related injury ( i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running ) was similar between groups ( ChiRunning , 4 [ 1.2 to 8.4 ] vs. control , 3 [ 0.7 to 7.1 ] injuries per 100 h of running , p = 0.72 ) although self - reported running - related discomfort ( i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running ) trended higher in the ChiRunning group ( ChiRunning , 10 [ 5.4 to 16.8 ] vs. control , 4 [ 1.5 to 9 ] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running , p = 0.06 ) . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure . We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury , but did see a positive change in BMI over time .

Postanesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) and hospital stay , hemodynamic parameters , and side effects were all recorded for each patient . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : Significantly , less number of patients and less dosage of esmolol were required ( P = 0.0040 and 0.0001 , respectively ) in Group F as compared to that in Group C. Again , number of patients requiring fentanyl and dosage of the same drug was significantly lower in Group F. Dose of propofol for the maintenance of BIS was significantly lower in Group F. However , the duration of controlled hypotension was almost similar in both groups . Group F patients suffered significantly less nasal bleeding and surgeon 's satisfaction score was also high in this group . Discharge time from PACU and hospital was similar between two groups without any appreciable side effects . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : Flupirtine as a premedication found to be providing more favorable perioperative hemodynamic conditions , analgesia and thus allowing less nasal bleeding as well as more surgeons ' satisfaction score .",deeplift,Group F receiving preoperative flupirtine || Group C receiving identical-looking placebo || Side effects,"[(293, 310)]",2,dev,deeplift
600,3759706_1,3759706,"TITLE : Up - dosing with bilastine results in improved effectiveness in cold contact urticaria ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Cold contact urticaria ( CCU ) is characterized by itchy wheal and flare responses due to the release of histamine and other pro - inflammatory mediators after exposure to cold . The treatment of choice is nonsedating antihistamines , dosages of which may be increased up to fourfold if standard doses are ineffective . Here , we assess the effects of a standard 20 mg dose and up - dosing to 40 and 80 mg of bilastine in reducing the symptoms of CCU and inflammatory mediator release following cold challenge . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty patients with CCU were included in this randomized , crossover , double - blind , placebo - controlled 12-week study . They received placebo , 20 , 40 or 80 mg of bilastine daily each for 7 days with 14-day washout periods . The primary readout was change in critical temperature thresholds ( CTT ) . Secondary readouts were changes in pruritus , levels of histamine IL-6 , IL-8 and TNF - α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Bilastine 20 mg was highly effective ( P < 0.0001 ) in reducing CTT . Up - dosing to 80 mg significantly ( P < 0.04 ) increased its effectiveness . At this dose , 19 of 20 ( 95 % ) patients responded to treatment , with 12 of 20 ( 60 % ) becoming symptom free . Only one patient was refractory to treatment . Microdialysis levels of histamine , IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1–3 h after cold challenge were significantly ( P < 0.05 ) decreased following up - dosing with 80 mg bilastine . Bilastine treat - ment was well tolerated without evidence of increased sedation with dose escala - tion . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Bilastine was effective in reducing the symptoms of patients with CCU . Increased efficacy of bilastine with fourfold up - dosing was without sedation and supports urticaria treatment guidelines .",lime,Bilastine updosing to 80 mg || placebo || Cold contact urticaria (CCU) change in critical temperature thresholds (CTT),"[(197, 228)]",5,dev,lime

As monotherapy in patients with CLL , it has no clinical activity . Here we report the results of an open - label , randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin , cyclophosphamide and rituximab ( PCR ) either without or with bevacizumab ( PCR - B ) in previously untreated CLL patients . A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled , 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR - B. A higher rate of grade 3 - 4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR - B ( 33 % vs. 3 % , p < 0.003 ) . Patients treated with PCR - B had a trend for a higher complete remission ( CR ) rate ( 54.5 % vs 31.3 % ; p = 0.08 ) , longer progression - free survival ( PFS)(p = 0.06 ) and treatment - free survival ( TFS)(p = 0.09 ) . No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab . A significant post - treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR - B arm ( 29.77 to 57.05 pg / mL ) ; in the PCR - B arm , lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR ( p = 0.01 ) . In conclusion , the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well - tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS .",scaled attention,chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (PCR-B) || chemoimmunotherapy without bevacizumab (PCR) || CCL-3 levels with achievement of complete remission (CR),"[(250, 274)]",3,dev,scaled attention

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns ' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub - Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining . We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource - limited setting . We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This study was an open label pragmatic cluster - randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation . 2550 pregnant women ( 1311 interventions and 1239 controls ) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery . 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care . The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text - message and voucher component . Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy . Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination , preventive treatment for malaria , gestational age at last antenatal care visit , and antepartum referral . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance . In the intervention group 44 % of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31 % in the control group ( OR , 2.39 ; 95 % CI , 1.03 - 5.55 ) . There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The wired mothers ' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services , more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred . Mobile phone applications may contribute towards improved maternal and newborn health and should be considered by policy makers in resource - limited settings .

From the viewpoint of long - term continuity of activity , it is necessary to develop various cognitive stimulating programs . The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a cognitive intervention through a training program for picture book reading for community - dwelling older adults . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Fifty - eight Japanese older participants were divided into the intervention and control groups using simple randomization ( n = 29 vs 29 ) . In the intervention group , participants took part in a program aimed at learning and mastering methods of picture book reading as a form of cognitive training intervention . The control group listened to lectures about elderly health maintenance . Cognitive tests were conducted individually before and after the programs . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : The rate of memory retention , computed by dividing Logical Memory delayed recall by immediate recall , showed a significant interaction ( p < .05 ) in analysis of covariance . Simple main effects showed that the rate of memory retention of the intervention group improved after the program completion ( p < .05 ) . In the participants with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) examined by Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA - J ) ( n = 14 vs 15 ) , significant interactions were seen in Trail Making Test - A ( p < .01 ) , Trail Making Test - B ( p < .05 ) , Kana pick - out test ( p < .05 ) and the Mini - Mental State Examination ( p < .05 ) .

This suggests that macrophage activation is involved in the pathogenesis of conditions is characterised by adaptions in the lipid metabolism . Since sCD163 is shed to serum by inflammatory signals including lipopolysaccharides ( LPS , endotoxin ) , we investigated sCD163 and correlations with lipid metabolism following LPS exposure . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Eight healthy male subjects were investigated on two separate occasions : ( i ) following an LPS exposure and ( ii ) following saline exposure . Each study day consisted of a four - hour non - insulin - stimulated period followed by a two - hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp period . A 3H - palmitate tracer was used to calculate the rate of appearance ( Rapalmitate ) . Blood samples were consecutively obtained throughout each study day . Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained for western blotting . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : We observed a significant two - fold increase in plasma sCD163 levels following LPS exposure ( P < 0.001 ) , and sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with the plasma concentration of free fatty acids , Rapalmitate , lipid oxidation rates and phosphorylation of the hormone - sensitive lipase at serine 660 in adipose tissue ( P < 0.05 , all ) . Furthermore , sCD163 concentrations correlated positively with plasma concentrations of cortisol , glucagon , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF)-α , interleukin ( IL)-6 and IL-10 ( P < 0.05 , all ) .

This study aims to assess changes in attitudes toward patient safety culture and frequency of quality - related event ( QRE ) reporting after guided implementation of a continuous quality improvement ( CQI ) program in a panel of community pharmacies in the United States ( U.S. ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Twenty - one community pharmacies volunteered to participate in the project and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups . Pharmacy staff in the intervention group received guided training to ensure full implementation of a CQI program while those in the control group partially implemented the program . Pharmacy staff in both groups completed retrospective pre - post safety culture questionnaires and reported medication errors and near misses that occurred in their practices . Rasch analysis was applied to assess questionnaire validity and reliability and to confirm if the ordinal level data approximated interval level measures . Paired t - tests and repeated measure analysis of covariance tests were subsequently used to compare observed changes in the attitudes of subjects and frequency of QREs reporting in intervention and control groups . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Sixty - nine employees completed the questionnaire , a 43.9 % response rate . Improvement in attitudes toward patient safety was statistically significant in the intervention group in six domains : staff , training , and skill ( p = 0.017 ) ; patient counseling ( p = 0.043 ) ; communication about mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; response to mistakes ( p < 0.001 ) ; organizational learning – continuous improvement ( p < 0.001 ) ; and overall patient safety perceptions ( p = 0.033 ) . No significant differences were observed in QRE reporting rates between intervention and control groups . However , differences were observed in the types of QREs reported ( e.g. , incorrect safety cap ) and the point in the prescription processing workflow where a QRE was detected ( e.g. , partner check station , and drug utilization review station ) in the intervention group ( p < 0.001 ) .

Our objective was to assess the validity of gestational age estimated from prospectively collected date of last menstrual period ( LMP ) using crown - rump length ( CRL ) measured in early pregnancy by ultrasound . ABSTRACT.METHODS : As part of a large , cluster - randomized , controlled trial in rural Bangladesh , we collected dates of LMP by recall and as marked on a calendar every 5 weeks in women likely to become pregnant . Among those with a urine - test confirmed pregnancy , a subset with gestational age of < 15 weeks ( n = 353 ) were enrolled for ultrasound follow - up to measure CRL . We compared interview - assessed LMP with CRL gestational age estimates and classification of preterm , term , and post - term births . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : LMP - based gestational age was higher than CRL by a mean ( SD ) of 2.8 ( 10.7 ) days ; differences varied by maternal education and preterm birth ( P < 0.05 ) . Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient was good at ultrasound [ 0.63 ( 95 % CI 0.56 , 0.69 ) ] and at birth [ 0.77 ( 95 % CI 0.73 , 0.81 ) ] .

ABSTRACT.METHODS : 225 healthy volunteers ( healthy , BMI 28–34.9 ) were randomized into four groups ( 1:1:1:1 ) , using a computer - generated sequence , for 6 months of double - blind , parallel treatment : 1 ) Placebo , microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 2 ) LU , 12 g / d ; 3 ) B420 , 1010 CFU / d in microcrystalline cellulose , 12 g / d ; 4 ) LU + B420 , 12 g + 1010 CFU / d . Body composition was monitored with dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry , and the primary outcome was relative change in body fat mass , comparing treatment groups to Placebo . Other outcomes included anthropometric measurements , food intake and blood and fecal biomarkers . The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT01978691 ) . ABSTRACT.FINDINGS : There were marked differences in the results of the Intention - To - Treat ( ITT ; n = 209 ) and Per Protocol ( PP ; n = 134 ) study populations . The PP analysis included only those participants who completed the intervention with > 80 % product compliance and no antibiotic use . In addition , three participants were excluded from DXA analyses for PP due to a long delay between the end of intervention and the last DXA measurement . There were no significant differences between groups in body fat mass in the ITT population . However , LU + B420 and B420 seemed to improve weight management in the PP population . For relative change in body fat mass , LU + B420 showed a − 4.5 % ( − 1.4 kg , P = 0.02 , N = 37 ) difference to the Placebo group , whereas LU ( + 0.3 % , P = 1.00 , N = 35 ) and B420 ( − 3.0 % , P = 0.28 , N = 24 ) alone had no effect ( overall ANOVA P = 0.095 , Placebo N = 35 ) . A post - hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 ( − 4.0 % , P = 0.002 vs. Placebo ) . Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region , and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference . B420 and LU + B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo . Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU + B420 group and in the overall population . There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events . ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION : This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass . B420 and LU + B420 also reduced waist circumference and food intake , whereas LU alone had no effect on the measured outcomes .",lime,Litesse® Ultra polydextrose  ́+ Bifidobacterium animalisssp. lactis 420 || Placebo || Energy intake,"[(478, 492)]",5,dev,lime
218,5346637_3,5346637,"TITLE : A randomized phase II trial comparing chemoimmunotherapy with or without bevacizumab in previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ABSTRACT : Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) with in vitro pro - apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects on chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) cells . As monotherapy in patients with CLL , it has no clinical activity . Here we report the results of an open - label , randomized phase II trial comparing the combination of pentostatin , cyclophosphamide and rituximab ( PCR ) either without or with bevacizumab ( PCR - B ) in previously untreated CLL patients . A total of 65 evaluable patients were enrolled , 32 receiving PCR and 33 PCR - B. A higher rate of grade 3 - 4 cardiovascular toxicity was observed with PCR - B ( 33 % vs. 3 % , p < 0.003 ) . Patients treated with PCR - B had a trend for a higher complete remission ( CR ) rate ( 54.5 % vs 31.3 % ; p = 0.08 ) , longer progression - free survival ( PFS)(p = 0.06 ) and treatment - free survival ( TFS)(p = 0.09 ) . No differences in PFS and TFS by IGHV mutational status were observed with the addition of bevacizumab . A significant post - treatment increase in VEGF levels was observed in the PCR - B arm ( 29.77 to 57.05 pg / mL ) ; in the PCR - B arm , lower baseline CCL-3 levels were significantly associated with achievement of CR ( p = 0.01 ) . In conclusion , the addition of bevacizumab to chemoimmunotherapy in CLL is generally well - tolerated and appears to prolong PFS and TFS .",ig,chemoimmunotherapy with bevacizumab (PCR-B) || chemoimmunotherapy without bevacizumab (PCR) || treatment-free survival (TFS),"[(206, 224)]",0,dev,ig
234,4285787_4,4285787,"TITLE : Canagliflozin : Effects in overweight and obese subjects without diabetes mellitus ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effects of canagliflozin , a sodium glucose co - transporter 2 inhibitor , on body weight in overweight and obese subjects ( body mass index [ BMI ] ≥27 and < 50 kg / m2 ) . ABSTRACT.METHODS : This 12-week , Phase 2b , randomized , double - blind study enrolled 376 subjects without diabetes mellitus who received canagliflozin 50 , 100 , or 300 mg or placebo once daily . The primary endpoint was the percent change in body weight from baseline through Week 12 . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Canagliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion in a dose - dependent manner and produced statistically significant reductions in body weight compared with placebo ( least squares mean percent changes from baseline of −2.2 % , −2.9 % , −2.7 % , and −1.3 % with canagliflozin 50 , 100 , and 300 mg and placebo ; P < 0.05 for all comparisons ) . Overall adverse event ( AE ) rates were similar across groups . Canagliflozin was associated with higher rates of genital mycotic infections in women , which were generally mild and led to few study discontinuations . Osmotic diuresis - related AE rates were low and similar across groups . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : In overweight and obese subjects without diabetes mellitus , canagliflozin significantly reduced body weight compared with placebo and was generally well tolerated .",attention,Canagliflozin || Placebo || Body weight reduction,"[(108, 171)]",1,dev,attention
674,4882374_2,4882374,"TITLE : Impact of Disease Duration on the Effects of Pramlintide in Type 1 Diabetes : A Post Hoc Analysis of Three Clinical Trials ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Adjunctive mealtime use of the amylin analog pramlintide improves postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes . This post hoc analysis of three randomized trials evaluated whether disease duration affected responses to pramlintide . ABSTRACT.METHODS : Patients received mealtime pramlintide 30 or 60 μg ( n = 714 ) or placebo ( n = 537 ) as an adjunct to insulin and were stratified into tertiles by diabetes duration at baseline . Efficacy and safety end points were assessed at week 26 using analysis of covariance and logistic regression models . ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Disease durations for tertiles 1 , 2 , and 3 were 6.7 , 16.5 , and 29.9 years , respectively . In all tertiles , pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and weight than placebo , with greater weight reductions and insulin sparing in tertiles 2 and 3 . Insulin dose and weight increased in the placebo group in all tertiles . Baseline HbA1c was a predictor of HbA1c lowering in both treatment groups ( P < 0.0001 ) ; higher daily insulin predicted a smaller percent increase in insulin dose for placebo ( P = 0.01 ) ; and higher body weight predicted greater weight loss in both pramlintide- and placebo - treated patients ( P < 0.05 ) . Event rates for severe hypoglycemia were similar for pramlintide and placebo and increased with longer duration of diabetes for both groups . Nausea with pramlintide increased with longer disease duration . ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : Mealtime pramlintide resulted in greater reductions in HbA1c than placebo , regardless of diabetes duration at baseline . Longer disease duration appeared to augment insulin sparing and weight loss with pramlintide , with a potential for increased incidence of hypoglycemia and nausea .
