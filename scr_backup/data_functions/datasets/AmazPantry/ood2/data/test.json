        "text": "if you want the benefits of coconut oil ( or any oil ) then ideally choose an unrefined product , usually labeled as virgin or sometimes as extra virgin . virgin oils are extracted by a mechanical method such as expeller pressing and if it 's pressed under temperature - controlled conditions ( not exceeding qqq ) is referred to a \" cold - pressed \" . as you can imagine , this is considerably better than extraction with a petrochemical solvent such as hexane . ideally , it should also be organic , unbleached , and free of any added ingredients . the nature 's way product achieves all of these criteria . they have updated their product labels ( for qqq oz and prime pantry versions ) but switched from using the correct term \" pure virgin \" to the incorrect term \" extra virgin \" ( extra virgin is specific to olive oil ) , and also do n't state \" cold pressed \" any more ( but their website does ) - their marketing dept . needs to work on that . i tried nutiva 's refined coconut oil recently - they take dried coconut ( copra ) and extract the oil using only steam ( avoiding chemicals and maintaining organic status ) . the main benefit from this is a qqq increase in the smoke point ( to qqq ) compared to unrefined coconut oil . it loses the coconut flavor in the process , which i miss , but it 's more suitable for stir fries ( if you like to crank up the heat ) or for baking . cooking with the nature 's way coconut oil is nice - it adds a slightly sweet , faintly coconutty flavor to the food but it wo n't dominate other flavors . popcorn popped in the oil is especially good ! the smoke point is about qqq lower than that of extra virgin olive oil so do n't use super - high heat . it 's also a very good moisturizer and a tiny bit goes a long way . the coconut oil miracle book is worth a read ( or at least a skim ; it 's very repetitive ) - it may be responsible for a good part of the resurgence in coconut oil sales . i think everyone would agree by now that not all fats are equal , and the medium chain saturated fatty acids in coconut oil are definitely a world apart from the longer unsaturated fats found in conventional vegetable oil . one of the most interesting aspects for me is that unsaturated fat in vegetable oil can generate free radicals when exposed to high heat during extraction ( i.e. those oils not labeled as \" cold - pressed \" or \" expeller - pressed \" ) or high - temperature cooking or even just prolonged storage . these free radicals can cause aging and cancer . if you use regular vegetable oil ( or seed oils like sunflower , canola , etc . ) it 's best to store it in the fridge to avoid oxidation , or at least in a cool place away from light - their shelf life is actually less than a year once opened . because coconut oil is high in saturated fat it 's actually slow to oxidize and therefore stable for longer than vegetable oils . sustainability : organic coconut oil has a significantly lower environmental impact than soy or corn oil grown in the us . in the qqq 's the american soybean association tried to kill coconut oil imports , falsely suggesting that it was a leading cause of heart disease . coconut oil has been making a comeback however - good news for pacific nations like the philippines where coconut farming supports a large part of the economy . like many of the major brands , the nature 's way oil comes in a plastic container ; it 's # qqq plastic so it 's recyclable in most areas , but that 's not as sustainable as glass . glass may be a little heavier to ship but it can be recycled over and over , while plastic has a limited lifespan and is also dirtier to manufacture . nature 's way has nothing to say on their website about sustainability ( energy use , waste , impact on communities , etc . ) , so either they do n't do a lot on these fronts or they 're just not good at marketing , or a little of both . one of the popular alternatives to nature 's way is nutiva , which donates qqq % of sales to sustainable agriculture and has a lot more to say about their social and environmental responsibility . just comparing the labeling on the two products , there 's not a huge difference . however , nutiva makes a good effort to support local communities , reduce waste , use renewable energy and offset the remainder by planting trees . so , overall i 'll give the nature 's way coconut oil qqq gold stars for quality of the product and qqq \" green \" stars based on the social - ethical - environmental aspects of producing it . it 's organically grown and manufactured by cold - pressing , plus coconut oil is more sustainable than corn or soybean oil . but it would be nice to know more about the company from a social and environmental responsibility point of view ; the product would get a fifth star if it was packaged in glass and was fair trade certified or if nature 's way provided evidence that they make a commitment to the farming communities .",

        "text": "i eat kashi cereal sometimes so i was interested in trying their bars to see how they compare . they taste decent not outstanding but not like cardboard either . but they are a little dry for my taste , so i think they fare best with a drink . the salt kick and chocolate both come across well even though its not high in salt . i think people will be drawn to them for nutritional content , and i think its pretty well balanced when you look at overall content . it has a carbs to protein ratio of qqq to qqq , which is close to what s considered optimal ; low in fat , very high in fiber and moderate in sodium . it also contains some ala not a huge selling point since qqq - qqq grams per day of ala is recommended and one kashi bar provides qqq mg ( you can get a full and more full and well - rounded dose of qqq fatty acids with qqq tbs of flaxseeds or cup of walnuts ) . the sweetener used , brown rice syrup , is really no better than sugar if you look into it , so there s no healthy benefit there . however , the overall balance ( qqq g fat , qqq g fiber , qqq g sugar , and qqq g protein ) is pretty good from a purely accounting point of view . i do n't love that the protein comes in the form of soy protein isolate however ( i.e. the leftovers after oil has been extracted from soybeans with hexane ) but that s common to most non - organic bars that use soy protein . their newer bars are organic and made with several fair trade certified ingredients ( including cacao ) but unfortunately they fall apart when you unwrap them . these chewy bars hold together better but are not made with fair trade certified cacao and that s disappointing . they need a combination of good ingredients and well - made bars . kashi is also a company of contradictions . for example , they are proud of their new non - gmo products ( this is not one of them ) and yet in qqq their parent company , kellogg , donated $ qqq to the no on prop . qqq campaign ( labeling of gmo foods ) . they were also i the news in qqq for misleading labeling of products as natural ( and using gmo ingredients ) the kashi 's general manager responded by stating , the fda has chosen not to regulate the term ' natural . overall i feel that they are a mix of good intentions and some bad practices that have seeped in as the company grew ( and was acquired by the kellogg company ) . the ingredients are not too bad : for example there s expeller - pressed canola / safflower oil instead of palm oil , which is nice ; but i feel that there are too many it feels like a highly processed product . since it contains wheat , nuts , soy and milk , that excludes a lot of people these days ! i feel that overall , for social and environmental impact , kashi is a little above average , and even kellogg ( the parent company ) is setting decent goals these days on things like energy use , waste , ingredient sourcing , etc . , even working with the wwf to evaluate impact for their products . these particular bars however , not having organic ( except for the cane syrup ) or fair trade certified ingredients , deserve a middle - of - the - road qqq green stars for social and environmental impact and also qqq gold stars for overall quality .",

' if you have to add a lot more fiber to your diet ( depending on your reason for taking : cholesterol , appetite control , digestive issues , diabetes , etc ) using the capsules can get expensive . generally the dosage reads qqq - qqq caps up to qqq times a day ( up to qqq caps a day ) . i take no more than qqq per day , so this bottle of qqq lasts about qqq weeks . as i write this review , my bottle is running low . conveniently , amazon has a $ qqq off coupon attached at this time . all said , i 'm happy with this product and i heartily recommend to others .",

( again , it 's an awfully strong flavor , so i use more than the recommended qqq ounces of milk , more like qqq and keep adding milk & mixing until it 's gone ... perhaps a qqq meal replacement by the time i 'm done . ) edit to add that i am not a trained medical professional , this is my experience with the product . another reviewer was gracious enough to give more information in a comment to this review . however , my way works for me .",

( i am talking about that grease film not the grease from cooking things like hamburgers , that i put into a disposable container for recycling ) . dawn is the product used to rescue the animals effected by oil spills in the water . it also helps keep my hands clean . because you do n't need to use a lot to clean , it is actually more economical than bargain soaps",
