        "text": "i bought these honey maid graham crackers via prime pantry and thought they were a good value for under two dollars for the qqq oz box ... these are one of our guilty pleasures . we do n't buy them often because , although they 're free of high fructose corn syrup , they do still have canola or soy bean oil and soy lecithin in them . they are a treat to our taste buds though for sure . we 've tried some other wheat versions but they 've yet to be comparable . these are slightly less thick than they used to be but still a long time favorite . recently , i 've used them to make an easy frozen dessert . it 's difficult to wait for them to chill , they 're so yummy but best when frozen . they consist of a mix of greek yogurt , cream cheese , some raw honey , pure vanilla extract , and lemon . i simply whisk together the ingredients and then spread them between the graham crackers and freeze them . also wonderful with strawberries added ( they taste a bit like cheesecake ) . my version is simplified but i 'll post a link to the recipe i use , in the comments below , if anyone is interested . the serving size says qqq crackers but reading further , that means qqq cracker \" sheets \" , which break down to qqq pieces . so two crackers are , qqq calories , qqq grams of fat , qqq carbohydrates , qqq grams of sugar , and qqq grams of protein . the small pieces are perfect for small children 's hands and who does n't love these ? smile . my other favorite pairing is with peanut butter . yum , yum ! i consider these a qqq star snack for taste but would love if they came out with a version that tasted as good , minus a couple of the not so good ingredients . then i 'd buy them frequently , rather than occasionally . uploading some photos so you can get a closer look . ours arrived with an expiration date of december , qqq ( just a few months out from our purchase date ) . recommended . enjoy !",

( it probably flies off the shelf . ) campbell 's soups are full of gluten and make me sick . it was so fantastic to find that progresso made gluten - free soups . wow ! thank you progresso ! ! ! ! ! this chicken enchilada soup is the soup i crave . i love food . so ... just to let you know , you can use this when you are craving a good mild cheese sauce . for lunch today i had some restaurant left - over spanish rice and refried beans . i simply put that on my plate , added a gluten - free corn tortilla and then covered it with this fabulous soup / sauce . yummo ! ! ! ! if you are a celiac like i am , you will find this soup delicious beyond belief . i will be making gumbo and using this as the sauce . i will be making homemade chicken vegetable soup and adding this soup . it has so many possibilities if you are a food fan . if this review helped please hit yes",

( concentrations in household / personal care products are thought not to be high enough to have an effect on human reproduction , however . ) this product concerns me because you 're using a spray and are bound to have some mist airborne . sure you want a well ventilated room and all that , but a shower is often a confined space . perhaps that 's why i , personally , have issues breathing when using this product . and there are people out there who knowingly or unknowingly are allergic to a couple of the ingredients in this product . so , if you like the product and none of these issues are relevant to you , great , but if you have n't tried the product , keep these in mind when you make your decision .",

        "text": "this product was on sale with prime pantry so i thought i 'd try it . i should state that i normally use seventh generation toilet bowl cleaner ( and a regular brush ) , so this product was quite a departure from what i 'm used to , but i figured i would give it a try and maybe use it for quick cleaning when i was in a hurry . in short , i am not impressed with this product , and here are my reasons why . first , the disposable \" sponge \" you attach to the handle is very small . this is adequate for cleaning the bowl where there is no water ( and i think it works decently under the rim , unlike some other reviewers , though a brush can do more ) and should work well for most of the bowl if you manage to mostly drain it first , though you need some water to \" activate \" the cleaning product on the sponge . however , seems too small and perhaps not abrasive enough to adequately clean near the \" drain \" area at the bottom of the bowl , which is where i find hard water deposits . second , the cleaning product is apparently dyed blue , which darkens the water to such an extent that it 's hard to actually see what you 're doing and whether your efforts to clean are actually making a difference . third , the cleaning product is very bubbly , which also makes it hard to see what you 're doing ( i know , i know , people think that bubbles mean that it 's working , but other products i use bubble less and still clean effectively ) . finally , i do n't think germaphobes will appreciate this product as much as they think they will : because the sponge is so small , some of the handle will have to get dipped in the water in order for you to clean , especially at the bottom of the bowl -- although i guess the handle is easier to clean than a brush . ( just make sure it 's dry before you put it back in the holder or it will drop onto your floor . personally , i spray the handle with a disinfecting cleaner and let it dry before putting it back . ) in the future , i will stick with my other cleaning products . the \" natural \" cleaners i 've used clean just as well , if not better , and i find a traditional brush more effective at cleaning and easier to use .",

( if it also contained macadamias , i would be doing a few twirls around the room ) . these nuts have been roasted and seasoned with sea salt . not overbearingly salty , either . these are about as close to nut nirvana a person can get . the bag is nice , because it is thick and can stand up and is also re - sealable . i get lots of my daily protein from nuts . and it is n't often that i get the deluxe bag because i am basically cheap . this brand is not overpriced and is affordable . with all of the holiday parties coming up , you may want a few bags so you can set out some snacks . these are also great if you are on a low carb diet . instead of meat and cheese , i will sometimes eat a handful of nuts , so you can imagine that i am going through a lot of nuts . oh , one more thing , nuts are high in heart - healthy fats .",

        "text": "general : no , these will not make you high mentally but yet i get high physically since three tablespoon of this beauty , once again only qqq tablespoon which is qqq gr , offer me qqq % magnesium and qqq % zinc which allows me to get to really high spots in the mountains with my mountain bike or catch those big high waves in the ocean since my muscles do not cramp due to magnesium intake of hemp seeds . what an absolute joke , in us they continuously talk about health care but yet this one creation of nature which offers so much not only is not produced in us but yet the only site that i trust for ingredients which is the usda nutritional value , will not offer me any info in regard to this superfood . now you probably get an idea why so many industries controlling your dear representatives in us senate will not allow hemp to have a chance to flourish in us . big pharma loves that idea since they sell those magnesium supplements which god knows what is in those unregulated tablets but yet citizens of us will not have access to the simple knowledge of all the minerals , vitamins , proteins and multitude of healthy hidden ingredients that this superfood offers at a reasonable price but yet they have all the nutritional value of chia seeds which hardly has any vitamin or mineral but yet a whopping fiber at a whopping price since it is no threat to any industry in us ... shame , shame , shame . while hemp and marijuana are kissing cousins , the amount of thc in hemp is almost non existent . two tablespoons contains qqq milligrams of anti - inflammatory gamma - linolenic acid and qqq grams of qqq fats , plus all nine essential amino acids , compounds that help maximize recovery from workouts . i consume these straight from the container with spoon , an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing . i consume it first thing in the morning or when i need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day . for years i have consumed qqq sunflower seeds , qqq in water qqq sesame+flax seeds ground in coffee maker+cocoa powder+unflavoured protein isolate , qqq seeds , qqq & garlic on daily basis . seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ of the seed so regardless of the type or brand , seeds need to be stored in freezer , in a dark , cold , sealed container , away from any moisture . if plastic container then it needs to be # qqq or for me it is much safer in glass containers that keeps air out . i consume seeds within two weeks and insure not to purchase in big quantities since freshness is a priority to me due to the nutritional value which i consume food for , any food . hemp is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in us since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy . no gain for big industries either since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma , plastic industry , fabric - cotton industry , pesticide producers , etc ... so if you live in us , canada becomes your only hope . hemp increases my level of energy without any artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar . more energy with less empty calorie fillers like sugar and saturated fat , in all energy bars which i never consume . hemp contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies , a component of a healthy immune system . healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein , essential fatty acids , fibre , vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories , starch , sugar or salt . one of the best natural boosters that i can get when doing any type of sport or when i need energy without a big meal . hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in us . victim of its own success . this is a super food next to quinoa , kale , broccoli , dandelion , raw honey , garlic , legumes , nuts , seeds , etc ... organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants . thank you , thank you , thank you canada . minerals : hemp is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed with highest magnesium , highest potassium , highest zinc and the healthiest fat . accordingly for qqq servings size of ; sesame__flax__chia__amaranth__quinoa__hemp__pistachio__almond__cashew__peanut_avocado calories qqq sat fat qqq calcium qqq magnesium qqq potassium qqq zinc qqq fiber qqq _ _ qqq phytosterols qqq / qqq freshness : fresh means nutritious and delicious . i consume lots of seeds , beans , grains , vegetables , etc . and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so i always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover . when fresh , food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form , from frozen to canned . fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste . when old or rancid , nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price , organic or conventional . for few years i consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless ; seeds are fresh , not old which means rancid , not in oil form , not in supplement form , not hulled , ground and consumed within few days , kept in dark cold temperatures , away from light - sun - moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless . that is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil . i ground in my coffee grinder sesame , flax , chia , amaranth , hemp then add cocoa , isolate protein , soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins , minerals , protein and many nutrients , without much spike in my glucose . un - hulled seeds are full of nutrients . i never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories , absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed . carbohydrates : carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in the muscles which weigh something like qqq grams per kilo of muscle . protein and fats do not get stored as glycogen ( additional weight ) . if you are a marathon runner , then it is not important how healthy or fit you may feel or look since if you did not consume enough carbohydrates then there is not enough glycogen in your muscles and you will not finish the marathon regardless . so i want healthy fat not carbohydrates . i want muscles not glycogen except on the days that i surf for hours and hours . fat : the most important hormone , and the one that 's crucial for weight loss , is insulin . insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage . a high - carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream , which in turn means you produce more insulin . the more insulin the body produces , the more fat gets stored . a low - carb diet means less insulin , making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored . for intake of a massive qqq calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low - fat , high - carb diet ; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories , with moderate exercise regimen each time ; low - fat diet stacked on qqq lb with qqq \" ( qqq cm ) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of qqq lb and loss of qqq cm ) from waistline . if calorie is calorie , then in my case and my experience shows that i would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia . almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts and that is a priority to me in type of calories since i am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat or chicken . accordingly for qqq oz servings size of ; amaranth__quinoa__flax__peanut__almonds__chia__sesame__sunflower__cashew__pistachio__chickpeas__lentils__spinach__avocado total calories qqq _ _ qqq calories from carbs qqq calories from fat qqq calories from protein qqq with only qqq % saturated fat , avocado offers so many calories from fat but from mono and poly fats which is the same for sesame seed as well making those superdfoods with lots of other nutrients as well . calories from fat are only healthy when such food is low in saturated fat and high in poly or mono fats . junk food usually provides a large number of calories per serving , with the majority of the calories from fat , unhealthy saturated fat with no poly or mono fats . on a qqq calorie diet , need to consume less than qqq grams of fat a day . for those reasons even consuming too many cashews are unhealthy since cashews hardly offer nutrients except high in zinc but very high in saturated fat . for almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia 's \" carb calories \" gain but qqq % more \" fat calories \" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss . sesame is my calcium but almonds are the superfood when it comes to fat calories and vitamin e. americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the grand canyon , priced for qqq but hardly with any nutrients vs. sesame . none offer ala and not only flax 's high ala is needed but it balances the qqq which is so abandoned in all foods and not healthy at all . but , but , but , hemp is the king for magnesium , potassium , zinc where is needed most for my muscle cramps and goes with all my work outs .",
